<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little book leans much, as every modern
work on the subject must do, upon Mr. Richard
Simpson’s monograph: <i>Edmund Campion, Jesuit
Protomartyr of England</i>. In many points supplementing
or contradicting that splendid though
biased narrative, the present writer has gratefully
taken advantage of the researches of the
Rev. John Hungerford Pollen, S.J. It may
also be useful to state that the contemporary
citations, when not otherwise specified, are
from two invaluable witnesses, Parsons and
Allen. The translated passages have been
compared with the originals, and sometimes
newly rendered.</p>

EDMUND CAMPION</div>



<h2>I<br />

<small>YOUTH: LONDON, OXFORD: 1540-1566</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Campion family seem to have
been both gentlefolk and yeomen,
and to have been widely scattered
over the land: in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire,
Essex, Sussex, and Devon.
Nothing is definitely known, at present, as
to which branch of the Campion family the
Blessed Edmund belonged. Unlike many
of the martyrs of Tudor and Stuart times,
he was what is called a “born” Catholic:
in more accurate phrase, a born heathen,
as we all are! but baptized in his parents’
religion soon after his birth in London,
on the Feast of St. Paul the Apostle,
January 25, in the year 1540, New
Style. Edmund had two brothers, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sister, none of whom played any great part
in his after life. By the time he entered
the Society of Jesus his father and mother
were both dead: his written expression is
that he had “hopes” they died in full communion
with the Church; but evidently he
did not know, being abroad, how it had
fared with them in those terribly stormy
days for Christian souls.</p>

<p>Edmund Campion, senior, was a book-seller,
evidently in good standing, but not
well to do. Some rich London guildsmen
(probably of the Grocers’ Company, for it
was they who maintained him later), befriended
the promising little boy at just the
right moment, when his father was reluctantly
going to apprentice him to a trade;
and he was sent, at their joint expense,
to a good Grammar School. Afterwards,
under the same patrons, he entered Christ
Hospital, then lately set up in Newgate
Street (out of confiscated Franciscan funds
and the generosity of Londoners), as the
“foundation” of the sixteen-year-old king,
Edward VI. Here the small Edmund, full
of life and laughter, banded and belted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
ran about in now extinct yellow petticoats,
and one of the earliest pairs of those historic
yellow stockings. He was thirteen,
and quite famous already in the school-boy
world of London for his learning and his
attractive presence and speech, when Queen
Mary Tudor, who had just succeeded to
the English throne, entered her city in
state. Out of many hundred eligible youngsters
it was he who was chosen to stand
up before her on a street platform, under
the shadow of the old St. Paul’s Cathedral,
and shrilly welcome her in the Latin
tongue. The Queen sat on a white horse,
robed in gold-embroidered dark velvet,
crimson or purplish, with the great sword
carried before her by the boyish Earl of
Surrey, with eight thousand mounted lords
and gentlemen on either side, all the glittering
ambassadors, and a bevy of beautifully
apparelled ladies. On certain figures in
that splendid and noisy pageant the child
might have looked with pensive eyes, had
he been able to forecast his own future; as
it was, he cannot have failed to observe the
Queen’s younger sister, the thin, watchful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spirited girl who was known as the Lady
Elizabeth. Another was there, of high
office, though not of high descent, who
was all goodness, piety and generosity,
and may well have been drawn to notice
Edmund Campion for the first time on
that sunshiny afternoon in August, 1553.
This was Sir Thomas White, then Lord
Mayor of London, a staunch Catholic. He
was an unlearned man and childless, who
became, later, co-founder of the Merchant
Taylors’ School, and enricher of many
towns. By 1555 he had opened his College
of St. John Baptist, once a Cistercian
house, at Oxford. The Grocers’ Company
at once approached him to admit their Blue-coat
ward as a scholar; this he did, and conceived,
almost as soon, a marked attachment
to him; and two years later (when Edmund
was not yet eighteen!) he made him a Senior
Fellow. Campion’s other early friends at
the University were his first tutor, John
Bavand, and Gregory Martin, a Foundation
Scholar like himself. These two
showed towards him a lifelong devotion.</p>

<p>Mary’s troubled reign had covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
five most susceptible years of his youth,
and restored to the country, despite its legal
excesses, a definitely Catholic tone. Things
were soon to change. War by statute
against the Mass was first declared in 1559.
Edmund Campion had left Oxford by the
time that St. John’s, deprived of President
after President by the Royal Commissioners,
was swept clean of all the dons who
favoured, or in any degree tolerated, the
jurisdiction of that Apostolic See which
safeguarded the doctrine and honour of the
Blessed Eucharist. But while he lived in
his University world, he lived untouched.
He was not looked upon as a Catholic.
Nor was he such, if his heart could be fully
judged by his outward actions. Buried in
literature, philosophy, and pleasant tutorial
work, he had become, in his cultured indifference,
what St. Jerome’s accusing
vision called a “Ciceronian,” and not a
Christian: a skin-deep Ciceronian, however.
There is only a bare possibility that,
on proceeding M.A. in 1564, he escaped
taking the wretched Oath of Supremacy,
and thereby acknowledging the Queen as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Head in spirituals as well as temporals within
her realm of England. He stretched his
conscience, as many were doing, thinking
to help along the unity of faith, thereby
defeating that unity for good and all. An
almost unprecedented vogue at Oxford had
served to blind him: he was so happy, so
busy, so needed, so much at home there.
Friends encouraged him; undergraduates
flocked about him, and imitated his very
gait and tone as they never have imitated
any one else except Newman.</p>

<p>Campion was a famous Latin scholar;
and he was a good Grecian and a good
Hebraist: Greek and Hebrew were studies
newly revived just before he was born.
He spoke as well as he wrote. The flamboyant
art of oratory, now almost extinct
in our more quiet-coloured century, was
then much studied and admired; and Campion
was famous for debates and addresses
and encomiums. When only twenty, he had
been called upon to preach, though a layman,
at the re-burial of poor Amy Robsart,
Lord Dudley’s young wife, in the University
church of St. Mary-the-Virgin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and this he did with great grace and animation,
and with no small display of tact, for
rumours of a murder with a motive had
already got abroad. Such prominence may
have come to Campion through Sir Thomas
White’s request: Sir Thomas had his
associations with Cumnor. Four years
later, Edmund Campion was able to put
sincere love and sincere grief into a funeral
oration (this time a Latin, not an English
one) for the good and dear Founder himself,
whose body was solemnly interred in
the Chapel of his College.</p>

<p>In September, 1566, Queen Elizabeth
made the first and happier of her two visits
to Oxford. In the Queen’s train was Dudley;
also a quieter, plainer, less noticed
man, but one out of all comparison with
him for astute power: this was Sir William
Cecil, the Prime Minister, afterwards
known far and wide as Lord Burghley.
There were farces and tragedies for the
Queen at Oxford, there were musical performances,
theological disputations, and
other academic sports. In front of the
vast assemblage stood forth Master Campion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of St. John’s, alone in his ruff, hood
and gown. As representative of the University,
he welcomed smiling royalty, and
Dudley, now Earl of Leicester, Chancellor
of the University, and royalty’s magnificent
favourite. Campion shone, as well, in the
absurd discussions in natural science which
followed. The Queen and Dudley marked
him, as they could not fail to do; for nothing
could exceed the courtliness with which
he had performed his task. The Chancellor
sent for him in private, and expressed
the Queen’s good-will, whereby Campion
might bid, through him, for whatever preferment
he chose. But Campion, always
truly modest and full of ironic humour as
well, would ask of his patron nothing, he
said, but his continued regard. The young
bookman had a real liking for the vicious
worldling, liked by several sensitively good
men, then and since. Sir William Cecil
also took instinctive interest in Campion
and his eager dialectics. Altogether, there
was no more popular man in Oxford or
elsewhere. Campion was on the hilltop of
professional and personal success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>In all this beautiful fountain-play of “the
things which are seen,” he was running
the very gravest risk of spiritual ruin.
Perhaps he could not know, in his leaf-hung
hermitage, what a tremendous
muster of souls was going on, now that the
ancient Church and a new statecraft were
to fight it out in England. Queen Elizabeth’s
quarrel with the Pope was hardly
more doctrinal than her royal father’s had
been: she, too, would have been quite content
to live all her days as a Catholic, provided
that Catholicism would prove her
slave. The battle was not between two
known religions. On one side was conservative
England with a belief; on the
other the strong spirit of secularism, plus
a few fanatics formed not by the English,
but the Continental Reformation. Religion
in itself troubled the Court party as little
as anything could possibly do. It was because
the spirit of Catholicism seemed to
them to threaten their particular kind of
national pride, and to interfere with their
particular kind of worldly prosperity, that
Cromwell in one great Tudor reign, Burghley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the other, tried to put it down. They
wished to get good citizenship acknowledged
not as an ideal, but as the supreme
ideal, and they cared not how much else
was shovelled out of the way. Their only
use for religion was to bring it well under
the authority of the law and the supremacy
of the Crown. They had no objection to
high respectability, but a most violent objection
to the supernatural life, because that
gives to those who practise it a dangerous
independence. Elizabeth wanted unity and
peace. Her subjects were to be forced by
statute to pray less and to pray all alike;
and to be thereby trained, somehow, to put
Sacraments and Saints and the Papacy out
of their heads. English humankind were
to forsake their happy wild life, as it were,
in the Church Universal, and all become, as
if by magic, one large tame pet lying in a
ribboned collar on the royal hearth. This
is a vision which has appealed to many
another head of a commonwealth as desirable,
though unaccountably difficult! Some
worthy persons have brought themselves to
believe that nothing to speak of happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
at the Reformation. But at the time,
everybody understood in the clearest
fashion that an old moral system which
would not come to terms had been dropped,
and a more satisfactory one created. It was
a working theory of that age, all over
Europe, that a governor had the right
to fix the belief of subjects. What was
wanted in England was made to order, out
of the rags of ruined doctrine and discipline.
Foreign Protestants raged over its
externals, as having too much of the old
thing, but the bullying State, riding roughshod
over Convocation and the laity, was
perfectly at ease, knowing that there was
more than enough of the new thing to
colour the whole, and to colour it once and
for ever. There was no affection for “continuity”
in those days except among the
“Romans.” The attitude of their persecutors
was that of men in a fury that any
Englishman should dare to connect himself
either with the world at large, or with his
country’s own disclaimed yesterday. The
State Trials, for instance, bear this out in
a score of places. Many an official answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
resembles the one made to that interesting
character Blessed Ralph Sherwin, when he
said truly that his coming back to his own
land was to persuade the people to Catholic
Unity. “You well know,” so the Counsel
reproved him in Westminster Hall, “that
it was not lawful for you to persuade the
Queen’s subjects to any other religion than
by her Highness’s instructions is already
professed.” The “received religion,” or,
as it was quite as often called, the “Queen’s
religion,” was simply the new idea of
nationalism torn away from relationship to
the arch-idea of nations, which is the law of
God. It was, in practice, no adoring angel
at the Altar, but a capable parish beadle at
the door. Now this was never the Catholic
conception of what religion has been, or is
meant to be. Happily, many thoroughly
patriotic Englishmen felt that no least jot of
Christian revelation, however much it stood
in the way of Cæsar, could, with their consent,
be put by; and to keep it free they
were willing to make themselves very disagreeable
indeed to their revered sovereign,
and to their more easy-going countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
With that rude definiteness which is ever
their chief family trait, the better Catholics
threw their full force against the Oaths of
Supremacy and Acts of Uniformity, as soon
as they understood their meaning. The
centuries passed since then prove that they
succeeded in holding asunder what the
Queen would join together. Was it unreasonable
that she punished the men who
tried to spoil her dream? And almost the
chief of these men Edmund Campion was
destined to be, though years were to pass
before he lent his whole heart to the work
God willed him to do.</p>

<h2>II<br />

<small>THE HOUR OF UNREST: OXFORD, DUBLIN:<br />
1566-1570</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THOUSANDS who were comfortably
placed in life, and conscientious,
too, had a great deal to suffer until
things were made plain. Edmund Campion
began to fret, and argue, and ponder,
and pray for light in secret, for several years
going about “that most ingeniose Place”
(as a later lover called Oxford) with heavy
thoughts. Oxford itself, despite the Ecclesiastical
Commission fixed there to worry it,
was more Catholic in spirit than any other
city in England. Nevertheless Campion’s
temptation to conform was very great. We
must remember that many of his first impressions
and memories were Anglican. He
was brought up during his early school
life on the new Liturgy, which came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
operation before his tenth year. He knew
now, in manhood, that to change about, and
forsake the State religion for the only
Church which is as exacting as her Master,
would be to see the ruin of his happy career.
His strong point, in the beginning, was not
what is called brute courage. His was the
nervous, Hamlet-like temper, natural to
students and recluses, which, by a fatal
error, puts endless thinking into what needs
only to be done.</p>

<div class="caption">Bld. Edmund Campion in Proctor’s robes.<br />

<small>(Gateway of St. John’s College, Oxford, in background)</small></div>
</div>

<p>During these years Campion read a great
deal of theology, as in his position he was
bound to do, according to University rules.
Where everything else except his inmost
heart inclined him to heresy, the Fathers
drove him back upon the fulness of revealed
truth. The day which he spent with St.
Augustine, or St. Jerome, or St. John
Chrysostom, was a day on which (to catch
up the phrase of his friend and biographer,
Fr. Robert Parsons, himself a Balliol man)
he was ready “to pull out this thorn of conscience.”
But on the morrow returned the
old spirit of obstinacy and delay. Meanwhile
the Anglican influence was gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for Campion’s dearest friend of many,
Richard Cheyney, the Lord Bishop of
Gloucester, was drawing him on towards his
own ideals, which were “Catholic-minded,”
if not Catholic. The learned, gentle and
lovable Cheyney withstood with zest the
risen Puritan party, and in his hold on
sound doctrine stood apart from all his colleagues
on the Episcopal Bench. He had
been brought up as a Catholic, and ordained
according to the full Catholic ritual, in
1534. The reminder is sometimes needed
that Protestants did not shoot up full-grown,
that all original Protestantism was made up
of human material once Catholic. From
first to last, however, Cheyney could not
be forced to coerce the Church which he had
abandoned. In this he stood not, as has
been stated, quite alone among the Elizabethan
Bishops, for Downham of Chester
and Ghest of Rochester shared his honourable
abstinence, though in less degree. The
moment Cheyney was out of the way, the
Catholics on his diocesan ground, hitherto
safe, were mercilessly harried. He had
been made a Bishop against his will, displacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the true occupant of the See, when
his friend Edmund Campion was two-and-twenty.
In most matters Cheyney followed
Luther; Cranmer’s more heretical doctrines,
which prevailed on all sides in England, he
thoroughly hated. He longed always for a
reconciliation which was never to be, and
never can be. He longed to see the Catholics
(against the well-thought-out and oft-repeated
prohibition of their leaders, between
1562 and 1606) do a little evil to procure a
great good: namely, smooth matters over,
escape their terribly severe penalties, and in
the end become able to leaven the lump of
English error, by the mere preliminary of
attendance at the service of Common Prayer
according to law, in their own old parish
churches. The Book of Common Prayer,
as he would remind them, was expressly
designed to suit persons of various and even
contradictory religious views: Catholic;
not-so-very Catholic; ex-Catholic; non-Catholic;
anti-Catholic! Campion often
rode over the hills to Gloucester to sit by
the episcopal hearth-fire, book on knee, and
hear such theories as this, and sympathize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the lonely old man who “saw visions,”
and had little else in his vexed life to content
him. His strong double desire was
to save by his own effort for the Church
of England separated from Rome, that
great body of ancient belief and practice
sure otherwise to be lost in the flood of
invited Calvinism; and to secure Edmund
Campion himself as his intellectual coadjutor
and successor, as one of high gifts
likely to “drink in his thoughts and become
his heir.” The two were together, not only
in matters of dogma, but in all minor points.
Cheyney shared with Campion dislike of
politics, telling the Council that in such
matters he was “a man of small experience
and little observation.” He kept his old
priestly ideals, and would never marry.
Campion, too, chose to be a celibate. If he
gave his heart to either Church, he saw even
then that it must be an undivided heart. To
him, with his underlying tenderness towards
the ancient faith, and his dream of peacemaking
through compromise, which is so
English, and just in these matters so mistaken,
the mission thus opened out appealed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Half reluctantly, yet not realizing the disloyalty
of his act (as he himself tells us),
he allowed himself to receive from Cheyney’s
hands Deacon’s orders in the Church
of England.</p>

<p>His interior struggle, from this day forth,
went from bad to worse. With the unaffected
simplicity of his character, he talked
over his difficulties not only with Cheyney,
but with any one at Oxford who seemed
able to help him. As a consequence, the
Grocers’ Company, whose exhibition he still
held, heard rumours, grew uneasy, and
began to suspect him, ending in 1568 by
inviting Campion up to London to save his
credit by preaching at Paul’s Cross, and
publicly “favouring,” as they expressed it,
“the religion now authorized.” He begged
for time, and that being granted, for more
time. He attended a court of the Company in
order to plead engagements, and to say that
he was not his own man, while deep in
academic duties and at the service of undergraduates:
“divers worshipful men’s
children,” he calls them. He was Public
Orator and Proctor, in fact, by now, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as Fellow and Tutor of his College. (He
never resided long enough to take his
Doctor’s degree.) He exacted from the
Company a written statement of the dogmas
he was expected to avow; and finding it
impossible to subscribe to the hot heterodoxy
thus laid down, he cut his first tether
by resigning his exhibition.</p>

<p>His most brilliant colleague at St. John’s,
Gregory Martin, who had protested in vain
against Campion’s diaconate (which was to
cause the recipient extreme remorse for a
long time), had become a convert to Catholicism,
and sacrificed all his secular prospects.
He wrote to his dear friend to warn
him against ambition, and to urge on him
escape from moral bondage. “Come!” the
fervent letter cried; “if we two can but live
together, we can live on nothing. If this
be too little, I have money; and if this also
fails, one thing is left: ‘they that sow in
tears shall reap in joy!’” Such earnest
words, though seeming wasted, had their
share in shaking Edmund Campion’s rest.</p>

<p>With the summer term of 1570 his Proctorate
expired. He spent the Long Vacation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in tutoring the eight-years-old Harry Vaux,
eldest son of Lord Vaux of Harrowden, who
afterwards beautifully redeemed his childish
promise. The end of Michaelmas term
found Campion face to face for the last time
with that life which he had so loved, and in
which, with his scientific enthusiasm for
letters, he had been such a wonderful inspiration
to young men. There was no conscious
motive in his heart deeper than a
thirst for such freedom as had become difficult
in a Puritanizing University, when he
cut himself loose, slipped out of it for good,
and took ship for Ireland.</p>

<p>In the new move he had the approbation
of Leicester, and the companionship of a
much-attached Oxford disciple, Richard
Stanihurst, who is remembered by posterity
only for his grotesque translation of Virgil.
Campion may well have left home with the
understanding that he should have a clear
educational field in Dublin, but he arrived
a little too late. The outlook had been very
bright. Some good men then in power were
eager for the revival of the extinct University
of Dublin, an ancient Papal foundation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but ruined, as all the great Schools were
(most of them permanently, some only temporarily),
by the religious changes. The
chief supporters of the plan were enthusiastic,
far-sighted, and most liberally inclined
towards Catholics. Fear and prejudice
therefore stepped in, in the person of Elizabeth’s
Irish Bishops. The Lord Chancellor,
Dr. Weston, wrote privately to the Queen,
deploring the popularity of the scheme, and
begging her to take the unborn foundation
“into her merciful, motherly care.” She
followed that advice. In token thereof, in
due season arose Trinity College, Dublin,
as a complete checkmate to the earlier project,
quite safe for evermore from Papist
blight. Thus was Campion cheated of a continuance
of his natural vocation, in serving
upon the staff of the new University. Two
of his friends who had most concern in it
were James Stanihurst, father of Richard,
and Sir Henry Sidney, then Lord Deputy of
Ireland, who had proffered it lands and
money. Leicester would have provided
Campion with a letter of introduction to Sir
Henry, his own brother-in-law. The latter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
young son, Philip, was at this time a student
in Oxford, where his governor, Thomas
Thornton of Christ Church, afterwards Vice-Chancellor,
had been constantly in Campion’s
society. Sir Henry Sidney always
bore himself most kindly towards Campion.
The latter lived, a more than welcome guest,
under the roof of James Stanihurst, then
Recorder of Dublin, and Speaker of the
local House of Commons. Stanihurst was
the head of an Anglo-Irish family not openly
Catholic since Queen Mary’s reign. Indeed,
in his public capacity, he had often sided
against Catholicism, although he was as
friendly as Sidney himself to those who professed
it. In the midst of this temporizing
household, Campion, himself a temporizer,
came during the winter to be doubted by certain
bigots outside. Very possibly he was too
free-spoken. Campion “came to Ireland
believing in practically all Catholic dogmas,
even in the Eucharist, and in the authority of
the Council of Trent.” The impression may
have got abroad that his then unknown
variety of Anglicanism differed little from
the dangerous creed of times past, lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
discovered to be the proper business of
the police! Whatever the reason, Campion
began to be a marked man. Sir Henry
Sidney told Stanihurst with heat, that so
long as he was Governor he would see to
it that “no busy knave of them all should
trouble him,” on Campion’s account. Under
this unpleasant circumstance of espial, added
to the disappointment he had just undergone,
the sensitive exile presently fell ill,
and got a most affectionate nursing from the
Stanihursts, till his strength revived. He
started as soon to write a treatise on a
subject of which his mind, up to now, had
been full: the character and aim of the ideal
youth at the Universities. This <i>De Juvene
Academico</i> reminds us of a theme by another
great Oxonian who was in Dublin three
hundred years later, and had also to face the
heartbreaking failure of an Irish University
dreamed of, and not to be. Campion afterwards
recast his fine little work, and under
its second form it is to be found among the
few <i>Opuscula</i> published after his death.
His comely face and gracious manner were
quickly taken into favour in his Dublin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
circle. While he was gaining a contrary
repute on hearsay, the few who had
access to him nicknamed him “the
Angel.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hating idleness, and bent on
redeeming what may have looked like a
foolish absence from Oxford, Campion
planned the composition of a brief <i>History
of Ireland</i>. Friends helped him in “inquiring
out antiquities of the land.” He
was what we should call a thorough “researcher,”
a bird by no means common in
those early days. He went here and there
among musty manuscript records of the
city, and from library to library in the
country, happily gathering in his materials
for work. He had been some three months
in Ireland when on a March midnight there
came a sudden warning from the faithful
Lord Deputy, who was on the point of leaving
for England. Campion learned thereby
that Weston the Chancellor had pursuivants
ready to arrest him the next morning! The
Stanihursts acted at once, and hurried their
friend into the care of Sir Christopher
Barnewall and Dame Marion Sherry, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wife, of Turvey House, in the parish of
Donabate, eight miles away. There, breathless
with the sudden flight through the
dark, the three devoted escorts left him in
safety.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2>III<br />

<small>STEPS FORWARD: IRELAND: 1571</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Barnewalls were in feeling both
more Catholic and more Irish than
the Stanihursts, and they showed
Edmund Campion a no less tender hospitality.
The great house was in a beautiful
and remote situation. Running in and out
of it was a horde of laughing children, including
the eleven-year-old Janet who was
to become Richard Stanihurst’s early-dying
wife. Campion loved the hearty Knight,
their father, and their lady mother, whom
he calls “in very sooth, a most gentle
and godly woman.” Though he mingled
freely with the life of the family, he was
considerately given the great garret to write
in and hide in. Here he began his little
<i>History</i>. First of all, though, he sent back
a grateful missive in Latin to the men who
had been so providently kind to him. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Recorder, he says: “Was I not fortunate
in such friendship and patronage as
yours? How good, how generous it was of
you to take in an unknown stranger, and
to keep him all these months on the fat of
the land! You looked after my health as
carefully as after Richard’s, the son worthy
of your love. You supplied me, too, with
books, and made the best possible provision
for my time of study: may I perish, if ever
in this world, outside my room in Oxford,
I had sweeter dealings with the Muses!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Up to this, I have had to thank you
for conveniences; but now I must thank
you for my rescue, and my very breath,—yes,
breath is just the word! for they who
succumb to these persecutors are wont to be
thrust into dismal dungeons, where they
inhale filthy fogs, and are cut off from
wholesome air. But now, through you and
your children’s kindness, I shall live, please
God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. most happily.” The stress laid,
in this affectionate letter, upon the writer’s
appreciation of personal care, of the privacy
dear to students, of good diet and pure air,
tells its own tale of physical delicacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Campion was slight in build, and like many
another tireless and quenchless spirit known
to history, at no time really strong. He
ends by asking that his St. Bernard may be
sent on to him, and encloses a lively page
for his friend Richard, recalling the service
rendered in snatching him from danger, and
conveying him to Turvey House. “Is it
not hard,” Campion breaks out, “that beholden
to you as I am, I have no way
of showing it?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meanwhile, if these
buried relics have any flavour of the old
Campion, their flavour is for you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you
and your brother Walter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you, up that
whole night through, and he, summoned
to us from his wife’s side. Seriously, I
owe you much. I have nothing to write
about unless you have time and inclination
for a laugh. Have you? Then hold
your breath, and listen! The day after I
came here, as I sat down to work, into the
bedroom burst a poor old soul, coming on
what business I wot not. She knew nothing
of me, so seeing me suddenly at her
left, took me for a ghost! Her hair rose
on end; she went dead white; she stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
aghast; her jaw fell. ‘What is the
matter?’ quoth I, whereupon she almost
collapsed with fright. Not a syllable could
she utter, but made shift to flounce out of
the room, and pour into her mistress’s ear
how some sort of hideous spectre had appeared
to her on the top floor! This was
repeated to me at supper. They called the
little old thing in, and made her relate
her scare. We all nearly died with
laughter; and I was established as quite
alive.”</p>

<p>The book, put together, as was almost
all Campion’s literary work, under highly
disturbing conditions, is unfinished; and
what there is of it is sketchy and out of
proportion. One of its charms is its
character-drawing, including the speeches
with which, after the fashion of Livy,
Campion fits the situation by putting them
into the mouths of his personages. His
was a dramatic mind. He knew both
history and human nature: the latter knowledge
crops up everywhere in all that he
wrote, and spoke, and did, and supplied
him with no small share of his power over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
others. The outstanding charm of the
<i>History of Ireland</i> is its style, crisp, arresting,
bright with idiom: an idiom so noble
and so much his own, that one understands
the almost breathless admiration with which
his generation looked up to him and
listened to him. But this book, like the
<i>View of the Present State</i>, written some
seventeen years later by another gentle-hearted
Englishman, the poet Spenser, is
all wrong in its theory that to get any footing
in the modern world the “mere
Irishry” must be Anglicized. Campion
did not know the Celts, their laws, nor
their literature; he never came nearer to
them than through chronicles written in
scorn of them, or the daily table-talk, wide
of the mark, of the English Pale. Yet,
according to his opportunity, he loved the
country and the people, and deplored that
the descendants of a race of mediæval
scholars should be cut off from education.
Afterwards he felt that his rather helter-skelter
pamphlet represented limited knowledge
and unformed opinion; he speaks of
it as “premature,” and wished, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
lost the manuscript, that it might perish
rather than reach the public as it was. It
bore a dedication to the Earl of Leicester,
his “singular good lord,” in the hope that
it might “make his travel seem neither
causeless nor fruitless,” or, as he says
again in plainer language: “I render you
my poor book as an account of my voyage.”
It was first printed, without supervision
from the author, in a very muddled, unsatisfactory
way, by Raphael Holinshed in
1577; then in more scholarly fashion by
Sir James Ware, in his <i>Ancient Irish Histories</i>,
1633. We all remember how useful
Holinshed’s pages were to Shakespeare:
the twenty lines or so of the famous description
of Wolsey in Act IV, Scene 2, of
<i>Henry VIII</i>, is taken almost word for
word from what Campion had written,
and Holinshed had incorporated in his
<i>Chronicles</i>.</p>

<p>Nowhere in this little book, begun and
broken off at Turvey House, and purposely
non-committal in its religious expressions,
is there any sign that its author had
already, as some have thought, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the Church. For Parsons, his earliest
biographer, whose facts concerning these
years were supplied by Richard Stanihurst,
says of Campion that his purity and devoutness
in Ireland were marked, although he
was not in the Church. Fr. Pollen, summing
up the evidence of these written
pages, considers Campion “near to the
Church, but distinctly avoiding a confession
of faith.”</p>

<p>Chancellor Weston, a zealot of the most
pronounced Protestant type, made a livelier
pursuit after having been baffled by Campion’s
escape from Dublin. The latter found
himself quite unable to lead any sort of
orderly life, thanks to the restless hue and
cry after him; and one day he recognized
with a shock of horror the penalties to
which he was exposing the generous
friends, so far unmolested, who were giving
him shelter. His conscience would not
allow him to come out with a flat denial of
Catholic tenets or sympathies. His only
alternative, after a half-year in Ireland, was
flight homeward. Here once more he was
aided (though they were in great sorrow at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
his decision) by his Anglo-Irish friends,
those “dear friends which ever after he
loved most entirely, and they him.”</p>

<p>Richard Stanihurst, as private tutor to
the children of the Earl of Kildare, had
acquaintance with the Earl’s steward, Melchior
Hussey. This man (a character by
no means admirable) was about to embark
at Drogheda for a visit to England, and it
was arranged that Campion should be disguised
to pass as his Irish servant. Thus,
in the month of May, putting himself under
the special patronage of the national Saint,
and adopting his name, Campion boarded
the ship as “Mr. Patrick.” Officers of
the law promptly appeared on the track of
the quasi-Papist, delaying the weighing of
the anchor, annoying the crew, upsetting
the cargo, and questioning every passenger
on deck except the harmless-looking person
who stood “in a lackey’s weed” behind
Hussey. Edmund Campion was a born
actor. He put on and kept up a highly
stupid expression, while he was praying
with might and main for St. Patrick’s intercession
in his great danger! He had cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to thank his new patron in Heaven, although
the party of searchers swooped
upon his bags below deck, and carried off
with them the rough draft of his precious
manuscript, that <i>History of Ireland</i> which
he was to see no more for many a year.</p>

<p>The early summer of 1571 was ill-starred.
Various startling events had conjoined like
tidal waves to lift the misbehaving English
Government up to its highest pitch of
alarm. Chief of these was the Bull of Deposition
against Queen Elizabeth, issued
by the Holy See after consultation with
many temperate English advisers. John
Felton, a gentleman of Southwark, posted
a copy of it upon the palace gates of the
Bishop of London, on the morning of May
25, the Feast of Corpus Christi: by August
he was to pay for the bold act with his life.
The Queen of Scots had newly arrived in
England. London, by the time Campion
reached it, was in a ferment. “Nothing
was to be found there but fears, suspicions,
arrestings, condemnations, tortures, executions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Queen and Council were
so troubled that they could not tell whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to trust, and so fell to rigorous proceedings
against all, but especially against Catholics,
whom they most feared; so that Campion
could not tell where to rest in England, all
men being in fear and jealousy one of
another.”</p>

<p>Campion had not broken his old bonds,
yet nothing interested him so powerfully
as the things of religion. The love of God
was lying in wait for him, and forced his
hand. Of all possible places in London
where he might have gone on the 26th or
27th of May, he chose Westminster Hall,
in order to attend the trial of Dr. John
Storey, former Principal of Broadgates
Hall (Pembroke College) in Oxford, and
that University’s first Regius Professor of
Civil Law. Dr. Storey was very feeble for
his years, which were sixty-seven. By a
wretched breach of international law he
had been trapped at Antwerp, carried away
from his wife and family to England, and
arraigned for having “feloniously and
traitorously comforted Richard Norton,”
his own friend, the old hero of the Pilgrimage
of Grace. But the real cause of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
arrest and execution was a much larger
matter. He was a troublesomely consistent
person. He had spoken out in the House
of Commons against the new Liturgy in the
first Parliament of Edward VI, and against
the Supremacy Bill in the first Parliament
of Queen Elizabeth. He had been an
Ecclesiastical Commissioner under Queen
Mary. Foxe, in the famous <i>Book of
Martyrs</i>, lies in the most reckless way
about Storey’s part in those sordid bygone
persecutions, and Holinshed and Strype
and many another historian repeat Foxe.</p>

<p>Storey was an honourable and even
merciful man, but a man of his time.
People were much of a piece in the sixteenth
century when it came to holding to
the grindstone the nose of the unwilling!
There is this to be said, however: that the
Marian courts dealt out death to heretics
and malcontents, and candidly stopped
there, and were not inspired to any cruelty
more subtle; whereas Good Queen Bess not
only dealt out death very much more liberally,
but invented a poison for all the springs
of life. Her statutes, terribly oppressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the first, ended in what Burke calls the
most hateful code framed since the world
began: Penal Laws which, especially
from 1585 on, struck without mercy at
Catholics in their rights of worship, property,
inheritance, education, travel, professions,
public service and private liberties
of every kind. Another point to be noted
in passing is that Queen Mary persecuted
her subjects for changing their religion.
Her more ingenious sister persecuted them
for not changing it! Historians have not
dwelt much upon the difference, but to a
reader with some philosophy in him it will
have no little weight.</p>

<p>Dr. Storey was executed five days after
his trial, under even more horrible circumstances
than were usual. Edmund Campion
had then left England, after an exceedingly
short stay. His standing watch
in Westminster Hall had done more for
him than many arguments and exhortations:
it kindled a spark in him which
made him, in Lord Falkland’s phrase,
“ready for the utmost hazard of war.”
There was a cause to which he could run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
home; there was a vocation to which he
could climb: these opened out before him
as he stood in the surging indoor crowd.
“He was animated by that blessed man’s
example,” says Parsons, “to any danger
and peril for the same faith for which the
Doctor died.” Edmund Campion lost no
time. There had been enough of that sad
old game, and he was thirty-one years old,
with three quarters of his too brief life behind
him. Now he was awake, and had
touched, in the dark, his heart’s long-patient
Master. He set out at once for the
nearest stronghold of apostolic souls, the
English Seminary at Douay in Belgium.</p>

<h2>IV<br />

<small>CHEYNEY AGAIN: DOUAY: 1571</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">INTERRUPTED sea-voyages were his
fate. This time, half-way across the
Channel, his ship was hailed by a
Government frigate, <i>The Hare</i>, which
demanded to be shown the ship’s sailing
papers, and the passports of her passengers.
Campion had none. Moreover, as his
religion was suspected, the dutiful Protestant
frigate, homeward bound, promptly
swallowed him, bag and baggage. His
generous friends in Ireland had forced
upon him money for his needs, and the
captain who now kidnapped him found it
convenient to keep the money, but kind-heartedly
let his prisoner lose himself in the
streets of Dover. Other friends quickly
made the losses good. On Campion’s
second attempt to reach Calais all went
well. He did not lack his secular epitaph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
so to speak, at Court. It was not then a
legal crime, though it soon became so, for a
Catholic Englishman to leave the country
fast being made into a hell for him. The
mighty Cecil treated this expatriation as
quite voluntary. “And it is a very great
pity,” he chose to say, looking into Richard
Stanihurst’s gratified eyes, “for Master
Campion was one of the diamonds of
England.”</p>

<p>The date of Campion’s reconciliation to
the Church is unknown. It seems unlikely
to have taken place in Ireland. He may
have been absolved from his schism in
London, or else as soon as he had reached
Douay. There was a busy trade in wool still
flourishing at that time between Flanders
and England, and in the thrifty, kindly
towns of the exporting country refugees
formed a considerable part of the population.
Douay, properly speaking, Douai,
was called “Doway” by its foster-children.
The creation of its English Seminary was a
master-stroke of Dr. William Allen, Canon
of York, afterwards Cardinal, once of Oriel
College, Oxford, and Principal of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mary Hall. Indeed, “Oxford may be
said to have founded Douay.” Allen was
aided by many men of mark, notably by his
old tutor, Morgan Phillipps, and by the
latter’s bequeathed funds; also by the
Flemish Abbots and layfolk. Campion
seems to have been the eighteenth arrival
in the newly established house of young,
prayerful, enthusiastic men. He found
there as Professor of Hebrew, his beloved
Gregory Martin, and a learned colleague,
Richard Bristow, late Fellow of Exeter
College, the first of the Seminarian priests
to be ordained: two props and pillars of the
foundation. There also was Thomas Stapleton,
late Fellow of New College, the most
able Catholic controversialist of the age.
Five of the twenty English students enrolled
in 1571, joined the Society of Jesus. The
College, destined to speedy and splendid
development, was affiliated to the Douay
University, established some eight years
before it by Spanish munificence and a
Papal Bull. Here, then, Edmund Campion
came into his soul’s haven, “out of the
swing of the sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Dr. Allen’s missionary policy that
all his sons, before memory of them had
grown dim at home, should write to their
more undecided friends in England, doing
what they could to win them to the service
of Christ in the Church Catholic. Campion
sent a very long document to this end to his
venerated and now ageing friend, Bishop
Cheyney: a wonderful letter, in that live
Elizabethan English, which was bold as
surgery itself, yet charged with feeling.
Associating his beliefs with Cheyney’s as
the writer does, he helps us to understand
his own doctrinal position while in Oxford
and in Dublin. He failed in both places,
writes Fr. Morris, for the same reason:
“the position was a false one, for it was an
effort to serve two masters, and to live like
a Catholic and teach the Catholic religion
outside the pale of the Catholic Church.”
“There is no end or measure,” he now tells
Cheyney from Douay, “to my thinking of
you; and I never think of you without being
horribly ashamed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So often was I with
you at Gloucester, so often in your private
chamber, with no one near us, when I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have done this business, and I did it not!”
By “this business” he means confessing
Catholic truth, and urging Cheyney to return
to it. “And what is worse, I have
added flames to the fever by assenting and
assisting. And although you were superior
to me, in your counterfeited dignity, in
wealth, age and learning, and though I was
not bound to look after the physicking or
dieting of your soul, yet, since you were of
so easy and sweet a temper as in spite of
your grey hairs to admit me, young as I
was, to familiar intercourse with you, to say
whatever I chose, in all security and secrecy,
while you imparted to me your sorrows and
all the calumnies of the other heretics
against you; and since like a father you exhorted
me to walk straight and upright in
the royal road, to follow the steps of the
Church, the Councils, and the Fathers, and
to believe that where there was a consensus
of these there could be no spot of falsehood;
I am very angry with myself that I neglected
to use such a beautiful opportunity
of recommending the Faith: that through
false modesty or culpable negligence, I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
not address with boldness one who was so
near to the Kingdom of God. But as I have
no longer the occasion that I had of persuading
you face to face, it remains that I should
send my words to you to witness my regard,
my care, my anxiety for you, known to Him
to whom I make my daily prayer for your
salvation. Listen, I beseech you, listen to a
few words. You are sixty years old, more
or less” (Cheyney was really sixty-eight),
“of uncertain health, of weakened body;
the hatred of heretics, the pity of Catholics,
the talk of the people, the sorrow of your
friends, the joke of your enemies. Who do
you think yourself to be? What do you
expect? What is your life? Wherein lies
your hope? In the heretics hating you so
implacably and abusing you so roundly?
Because of all heresiarchs you are the least
crazy? Because you confess the Living
Presence of Christ on the Altar, and the
freedom of man’s will? Because you persecute
no Catholics in your diocese? Because
you are hospitable to your townspeople,
and to good men? Because you plunder
not your palace and lands, as your brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
do? Surely these things will avail much, if
you return to the bosom of the Church, if
you suffer even the smallest persecution in
common with those of the Household of
Faith, or join your prayers with theirs. But
now, whilst you are a stranger and an
enemy, whilst, like a base deserter, you
fight under an alien flag, it is in vain to
attempt to cover your crimes with the cloak
of virtues.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What is the use of fighting
for many articles of the Faith, and to perish
for doubting of a few?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He believes no
one article of the Faith who refuses to believe
any single one. In vain do you defend
the religion of Catholics, if you hug only
that which you like, and cut off all that
seems not right in your eyes. There is but
one plain, known road: not enclosed by your
palings or mine, not by private judgment,
but by the severe laws of humility and
obedience: when you wander from these
you are lost. You must be altogether
within the house of God, within the walls
of salvation, to be sound and safe from all
injury; if you wander and walk abroad ever
so little, if you carelessly thrust hand or foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
out of the ship, if you stir up ever so small
a mutiny in the crew, you shall be thrust
forth: the door is shut, the ocean roars:
you are undone!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you remember the
sober and solemn answer which you gave
me when three years ago we met in the
house of Thomas Dutton at Shireburn,
where we were to dine? We were talking of
St. Cyprian. I objected to you (in order to
discover your real opinions) that Synod of
Carthage which erred about the baptism of
infants. You answered truly that the
Holy Spirit was not promised to one Province,
but to the Church; that the Universal
Church is represented in a full Council; and
that no doctrine can be pointed out about
which such a Council ever erred. Acknowledge
your own weapons, which you used
against the adversaries of the Mystery of
the Eucharist!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here you have the most
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. apostolic men collected at Trent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
contend for the ancient faith of the Fathers!
All these, whilst you live as you are living,
anathematize you, hiss you out, excommunicate
you, abjure you.” Campion goes on to
urge upon Cheyney an outward adherence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the Council which had discussed and
resolved his own private beliefs. “Especially
now you have declared war against
your colleagues, why do you not make full
submission, without any exceptions, to the
discipline of these Fathers?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once more,
consult your own heart, my poor old friend!
give me back your old beauty, and those
excellent gifts which have been hitherto
smothered in the mud of dishonesty. Give
yourself to your Mother who begot you to
Christ, nourished you, consecrated you;
acknowledge how cruel and undutiful you
have been: let confession be the salve of
your sin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Be merciful to your soul;
spare my grief. Your ship is wrecked, your
merchandise lost: nevertheless, seize the
plank of penance, and come even naked into
the port of the Church. Fear not but that
Christ will preserve you with His hand,
run to meet you, kiss you, and put on you
the white garment: Saints and Angels will
sing for joy! Take no thought for your
life: He will take thought for you who gives
the beasts their food, and feeds the young
ravens that call upon Him. If you but made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
trial of our banishment, if you but cleared
your conscience, and came to behold and
consider the living examples of piety which
are shown here by Bishops, priests, friars,
Masters of Colleges, rulers of Provinces, lay
people of every age, rank and sex, I believe
that you would give up six hundred
Englands for the opportunity of redeeming
the residue of your time by tears and sorrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Pardon me, my venerated old
friend, for these just reproaches, and for the
heat of my love. Suffer me to hate that
deadly disease; let me ward off the imminent
danger of so noble a man and so dear
a friend with any dose, however bitter. And
now if Christ give grace and you do not
refuse, my hopes of you are equal to my
love: and I love you as passing excellent
in nature, in learning, in gentleness, in
goodness, and as doubly dear to me for your
many kindnesses and courtesies. If you
recover your [spiritual] health, you make me
happy for ever. If you slight me, this letter
is my witness. God judge between you and
me: your blood be on yourself! Farewell,
from him that most desires your salvation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>One phrase in this steel web of phrases
from the pen of a rhetorician with a heart,
shows that Campion knew of Cheyney’s sad
and now complicated position in England.
The letter was written November 1, 1571.
A Convocation had met in the preceding
April, on the heels of the Act of Uniformity,
to which Cheyney was summoned in vain.
It required the signing of the Thirty-nine
Articles, and enacted, under Archbishop
Grindal’s leadership, many things equally
hateful to Cheyney, such as displacement
and defacement of Altar-stones—(a great
symbol, this, and no mere act of pillage!),
the abolition of Prayers for the Dead, the
prohibition even of the Sign of the Cross in
church. Cheyney, excommunicated for his
wilful absence, afterwards sued by proxy
for absolution, for the sake of averting
temporal penalties: but he had nothing
more to do with the hierarchy. “Now you
have declared war against your colleagues,”
shows that Campion had heard accurate
news of all this.</p>

<p>The moment may have seemed to Campion
exactly favourable for such a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
appeal. One of Cheyney’s successors in his
See declared: “It was certain he died a
Papist.” This was contradicted by a lesser
authority, but yet a good one. If it were
indeed “certain”, at least Edmund Campion,
to whom the tidings would have been
most consoling, never knew of it. It seems
as if Cheyney could not have answered that
bugle-call of a letter. He is said, however,
to have kept it always, and to have called it
his greatest treasure.</p>

<p>How these many cries of “the heat of my
love” must have haunted his ear! It is
hardly in human nature to value such a
document at all (and there are passages in
it more ruthless, after the manner of the
time, than any we have quoted), unless for
the reflex reason that it does its intended
work in the heart of the receiver. To have
valued it either as a piece of literary cleverness,
or as a monument of misdirected concern,
would have been equally cynical, and
clean contrary to Cheyney’s known attitude
towards his friend. He did not live to see
Campion return to England. Shunning the
bigots and the unprincipled men in power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to the last, and sheltering the Catholics all
he could, he shut himself up at Gloucester,
a whole High Church party in himself,
wounded and at bay: and there in 1579 he
died, and was buried in the glorious
Cathedral, without an epitaph. The dream
of his lifetime, as well as Edmund Campion’s
sonship, he had loved and lost.</p>

<h2>V<br />

<small>THE CALL TO COME UP HIGHER: DOUAY,
PRAGUE: 1571-1573</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN Allen’s <i>Apology for Seminaries</i> there
is a beautiful account of the ideals
of Douay. “The first thought of the
founders of the College had been to attract
the young English exiles who were living in
Flanders from their solitary and self-guided
study to a more exact method and to collegiate
obedience; and their next, to provide
for the rising generation in England a succession
of learned Catholics, especially of
clergy, to take the place of those removed
by old age, imprisonment, and persecution.
Their design then was to draw together out
of England the ‘best wits’ from the following
classes; those inclined to Catholicism;
those who desired a more exact education
than could be then obtained at Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
or Cambridge, ‘where no art, holy or profane,
was thoroughly studied, and some not
touched at all;’ those who were scrupulous
about taking the Oath of the Queen’s supremacy;
those who disliked to be forced, as
they were in some Colleges of the English
Universities, to enter the ministry; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and those who were doubtful which religion
was the true one, and were disgusted that
they were forced into one without being
allowed opportunity of inquiring into the
other.” The spirit of Douay was not reactionary,
but the best spirit of the English
Renaissance. It had, besides, a character
or atmosphere holy and bright, not formed
by mere human culture: it was as “a garden
enclosed, and a fountain sealed.” Campion
found there a peace such as he had
never known. He had already, at Oxford,
given seven years to philosophy, and six
more to Aristotle, positive theology, and
the Fathers. The study of scholastic theology
was dead in Oxford: Campion now
first took up the teachings of St. Thomas
Aquinas. He arrived in June, and in
August he bought a noble edition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<i>Summa</i> for his own use, in three volumes
folio. This was discovered in 1887 by
Canon Didiot of Lille, and it is now at the
Roehampton Noviciate. Several features
make it a particularly interesting relic:
Campion’s signature, with the date of his
purchase, on the flyleaf; various beautifully
executed little drawings, underlinings, and
a host of marginal notes in Latin. By far
the most touching of these relates to what
St. Thomas quotes from Gennadius on the
baptism of blood. Blessed Edmund Campion
wrote in a tall, bold hand, over against
this passage, the one musing word, “Martyrdom.”
Canon Didiot, with that intimate
touch of French sympathy, calls it “<i>mot
radieux et prophétique</i>.”</p>

<p>For nearly two years Campion followed
the course of scholastic theology, taking his
degree of Bachelor in January, 1573. He
then received Minor Orders, and was ordained
Sub-deacon. All went happily for
him at Douay. He was again at his old
work, and, as ever, he won the highest
opinions from those among whom he
moved. In his Oxford days he had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
held lofty standards before his pupils:
“never to deliquesce into sloth, nor to
dance away your time, nor to live for rioting
and pleasure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but to give yourselves
up to virtue and learning, and to
reckon this the one, great, glorious and
royal road.” But the feeling in the exhortations
of his later life is tenfold deeper,
and strikes a far more haunting note of
duty towards England, and towards the
Church. This is a passage from the revised
<i>De Juvene Academico</i>, which had first been
sketched out years before in Dublin.
“Listen to our Heavenly Father asking
back his talents with usury!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Behold,
by the wickedness of the wicked the house
of God is devoted to flames and to destruction;
numberless souls are being deceived,
are being shaken, are being lost, any one
of which is worth more than the empire of
the whole world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sleep not while the
Enemy watches; play not while he devours
his prey; sink not into idleness and folly
while his fangs are wet with your brothers’
blood. It is not wealth nor liberty nor station,
but the eternal inheritance of each of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the very life-blood of our souls, our spirits,
and our lives, that suffers. See, then, my
dearest young scholars and friends, that we
lose none of this precious time, but carry
hence a plentiful and rich crop, enough to
supply the public want, and to gain for ourselves
the reward of dutiful sons.” One of
those who listened to these words was destined
to become the proto-martyr of the
English Continental Seminaries: Cuthbert
Mayne, a dear pupil of Campion’s, who as
a Devon lad had come up to Oxford and St.
John’s, had first conformed to the new
regulations, and served as College Chaplain,
then awakened from his delusion, and fled
over seas for conscience’ sake, “not to
escape danger, but to be prepared for it,”
in response to one of Campion’s burning
letters. This letter was intercepted, but its
purport had reached him, and decided him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1573, Campion found
himself driven to a course he had not contemplated
on coming to Douay. As he
slowly saw his way, he followed it, to horizon
beyond horizon. He had many steps
to take, because in his thirst for perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he had far to travel. He told Dr. Allen
he wished to leave his present life, go on
pilgrimage, in the spirit of penance, to the
Tomb of the Apostles at Rome, and there
seek admission into the Society of Jesus.
The mediæval Orders would have less attraction
for Campion: he was an intensely
“modern” man. Now this was a severe
blow to Allen: hardly less so to others of
Campion’s circle. Campion, the pride, the
example, the hope of the Seminary, to quit
it for good, and to quit it in order to join
the most recent of religious communities—one
which as yet had few English members!
It was inexplicable. But Allen, like
the great-hearted and broad-minded commander-in-chief
he was, let him go without
protest. He little foresaw that far from
losing his most promising champion, he
was but lending him to better masters of
the interior life than himself, and would
receive his trained strength again in the
English Mission’s spiritual day of battle.</p>

<p>Campion set out on foot across the Continent
for Rome, along that road “trodden
by many a Saxon king and English saint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to the Apostles’ shrine.” His companions
walked with him all the first day; but the
next morning he sent them back, and
pushed on alone. Solitude was henceforth
his choice, whenever duty permitted. He
must have had many strange adventures
during that spring journey. We know of
one of them, though not from him. At
some point of the route, probably on the
northern Italian border, he came face to
face with an old friend, an Oxonian, and
a Protestant. The horseman first rode past
the poor mendicant on the highway, and
then was prompted by some dim sense of
recognition to return and speak to him. On
realizing that it was really Edmund Campion
whom he used to know “in great
pomp of prosperity,” he showed much concern,
proffered his good-will and his purse,
and begged to hear how Campion had
fallen into that ill plight. But the pilgrim
refused aid; and the other traveller heard
something then and there of the “contempt
of this world, and the eminent dignity of
serving Christ in poverty,” which greatly
moved him: and “us also,” adds Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Parsons of Balliol, “that remained yet in
Oxford, when the report came to our ears.”
A strange tale it must have seemed to those
who knew their Master of Arts and all his old
fastidiousness! He was by now a saint in
the making, and they were fast losing touch
with him. Personal holiness is, so to speak,
a mining country: its progress and its
wealth are underground, unguessed-at by
the careless passer-by. A saint is a mystery
because he walks so closely in the
shadow of God, who is the Great Mystery.</p>

<p>When Campion reached Rome, and had
paid his devotions to the holy places, he
went to call upon Cardinal Gesualdi, who,
as he stated afterwards, “having some
liking of me, would have been the means
to prefer me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I, resolved what
course to take, answered that I meant not
to serve any man, but to enter into the
Society of Jesus, thereof to vow and to be
professed.” With this intention, Campion
sought out the newly-elected head of that
Society, Father Everard of Liège, whose
surname was generally Latinized into Mercurianus,
from Mercœur, his native village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He was fourth in his office, having succeeded
that great personality St. Francis
Borgia, on St. George’s Day, April 23,
1573. Biographers have represented that
Campion had a half-year’s delay in Rome
before he was able to apply for admission
to the Society; but such was not the case.
He promptly presented himself, and was
received as Mercœur’s first recruit, and
received not as a postulant, but as a novice.
As Anthony Wood tells us, “he was
esteemed by the General of that Order to
be a person every way complete.” Four
years later, Campion most affectionately
thanked his own old tutor, John Bavand, for
unasked “introductions, help and money,”
which had been supplied since he came to
Rome. He speaks of himself as “one
whom you knew never could repay you,
but who was at the point, so to speak,
of death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You were munificent to me
when I was going to enter the sepulchral
rest of religion.” The aid he would not
accept for himself on his journey from one
friend, he had accepted in the city (and
spent, no doubt, in almsgiving) from another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Perhaps Bavand was abroad, and
heard of that incident which came to pass
on the road: certainly, he was one from
whom Campion could not in chivalry
refuse whatever he chose to share with him.</p>

<p>The Society of Jesus had been founded
only six years before Campion was born.
It had as yet no English “Province,” that
is, no members living under the English
flag with a domestic government of their
own. But Edmund Campion was already
well known to the Provincials on the Continent,
who had a warm contest over him,
every one of them wishing to add such a
promising soldier to his own wing of the
army of the Lord. As it fell out, Bohemia
won. Campion was sent as one of a company
to Vienna, and then from Vienna to
Prague, where the Noviciate was, with
Father Avellanedo, Confessor to the Empress,
a man of wide experience. He was
so deeply edified by his companion that,
he told Fr. Parsons long after, it had kept
him all his life “much affectioned” towards
England and Englishmen. Prague
was in a miserable, godless state: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Catholics were poor and few: the great
University had perished: and all this was
due to the ruin, moral and material, produced
by the preaching, at the dawn of the
fifteenth century, of John Hus. That Hus
got his Socialistic ideas from Wyclif was a
fact never out of Campion’s mind while in
Bohemia: for he thought that England
owed some reparation to a country which
she had helped to spoil, and he was more
than willing to pay his part of that debt.</p>

<h2>VI<br />

<small>THE WISHED-FOR DAWN: BOHEMIA:
1573-1579</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">CAMPION stayed but two months at
Prague, as the small Noviciate was
removed to Brünn in Moravia, where
the inhabitants were most hostile to Catholicism.
The Bishop of Olmütz begged the
Jesuits to help him so far as their Rule permitted.
Novices were sent out among the
neighbouring villages, to catechize and instruct
the poorer Catholics; and no one had
so instant a success in this little enterprise
as “God’s Englishman.” At the year’s
end his Novice Master, John Paul Campanus,
became Rector of the College in
Prague, and took Edmund Campion back
with him. The latter left a good deal of
his heart within the gray and austere walls
of Brünn, as two of his charming letters
show. In the old garden, under a mulberry
tree, he had had a wonderful vision:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Our Lady stood there, smiling at him, and
offering him a purple robe. He knew the
portent of martyrdom, but for long hid it
in his heart. At Prague Campion continued
and increased his Douay employments.
He opened the October term with
what was called a “glorious peroration”.
As Professor of Rhetoric, he wrote, in 1574,
a beautiful little treatise on that subject so
familiar to him. His duty was to be first
in the house to rise and last to go to bed;
he spent his recreation-time catechizing
children, receiving converts, visiting the
prison and the hospital, or helping the
cook in the kitchen! In January, 1575, he
set up at his College a branch Confraternity
of the Immaculate Conception, or Sodality
of Our Lady, of which he became president.
About the same time he made his first
vows. He was continually called upon for
great College occasions, and to pronounce
public panegyrics. “Whatever had to be
done,” says his pompous but sympathetic
biographer Bombino, “was laid upon
him.” On getting a fresh task he would
ask his Superior, in a spirit of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
humility and confidence, if he was thought
strong enough to add that to the rest? and
if the answer were Yes, he shouldered the
new duty at once, much to the wonder
of others. “I am in a continual bloom
of health,” he writes gallantly to his “dearest
Parsons,” who had just entered the
Society; “I have no time whatever to be
ill in!” Two sacred plays (six hours did
it take to perform each of them!) came
from Campion’s truly dramatic pen in 1577.
One was on the Sacrifice of Abraham; one
on the melancholy career of King Saul.
It is a matter of much regret that these are
lost. He seems also to have composed
dialogues and scenes for his own scholars,
and to have put together at this same time
his spirited account of the origin of the
English schism, in a narrative (in Latin)
of <i>The Divorce of King Henry VIII from
his Wife and from the Church</i>. It was
printed by Harpesfield, long after Campion’s
death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rudolph II had succeeded
to the imperial throne; and the “magnificently
provided” Envoy who was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Prague, bearing the congratulations of
Queen Elizabeth, was none other than Sir
Philip Sidney. Sidney’s mind was set
upon seeing his old friend Campion, and
talking with him; but he managed only
with difficulty to carry out his wishes. He
went officially in the Emperor’s train to
hear his friend (not yet in priest’s orders)
preach, and on his return to England unguardedly
spoke with delight of the sermon.
Whenever Sidney visited the Continent he
was supposed to become tainted with a
hankering after Catholicism, though in all
his public actions he was conspicuously Protestant.
Campion, who knew him from boyhood
and was not given to misjudgment,
believed that he had almost won over the
star of English chivalry: “this young man
so wonderfully beloved and admired,” he
calls him in 1576; a testimony doubly interesting,
when we remember that Philip
Sidney was then but three-and-twenty, to
the effect which his short life made upon all
his contemporaries. “He had much conversation
with me,” Campion’s letter goes on,
“and I hope not in vain, for to all appearances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he was most keen about it. I commend
him to your remembrances at Mass, since
he asked the prayers of all good men, and
at the same time put into my hands alms
to be distributed to the poor for him; this
trust I have discharged.” He ends by
hoping that some of the missionaries then
going back to England from Douay will
have “opportunity of watering this plant
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. poor wavering soul!” Fr. Parsons
in his <i>Life of Campion</i> tells us that Sidney
“professed himself convinced, but said that
it was necessary for him to hold on the
course which he had hitherto followed.”
Such was the sad answer of Felix to St.
Paul.</p>

<p>Campion’s thoughts had turned often of
late to another friend, Gregory Martin,
who had left overcrowded Douay for the
Seminary newly founded in the heart of
Rome, in the ancient English hospice for
pilgrims. Campion longed to turn his
fellow-priest into a Jesuit, for he loved his
own Society in the extreme; but that was
not to be. A letter to Martin, glowing
with that interior fire which was shed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
from Edmund Campion upon everything
he touched, ends most tenderly. “Since
for so many years we two had in common
our College, our meals, our studies, our
friends and our enemies, let us for the rest
of our lives make a more close and binding
union, that we may have the fruit of our
friendship in heaven. For there also I will,
if I can, sit at your feet.”</p>

<p>After years filled with literary and
academic labour in two Colleges, and
blessed with marked growth in holiness,
Edmund Campion was ordained priest by
the Archbishop of Prague. His first Mass
was said on the Feast of the Nativity of Our
Lady, September 8, 1578. Following his
General’s express command, he dismissed
the old unhappy scruple about his Oxford
diaconate, and it troubled him no more.
He was made Professor of Philosophy.
“You are to know,” he pleasantly says,
“that I am foolishly held to be an accomplished
sophist!” During the course of
this year 1578, he wrote his last and most
famous drama, now lost, on St. Ambrose
and the Emperor Theodosius, which, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
acted, made a tremendous stir. He became
ever more and more noted as a preacher,
a “sower of eternity” in the popular heart,
as well as the favourite orator when
grandees died and were buried in state.
But all this time his mind and heart were
far away.</p>

<p>No one ever practised religious obedience
in a more heroic spirit; yet he secretly
longed to throw his life and his labours
directly into the balance for England’s
sake. He knew what was going on there,
and his thoughts seem never once to have
turned towards pikes, or any political
remedy; his whole ambition was, as he
said in one letter, to “torture our envious
foe with good deeds,” and in another, “to
catch them by the prayers and tears at
which they laugh.” His long-dear Cuthbert
Mayne, of whom he had lost sight for
awhile, had given up his life for the Faith
at Launceston, November 29, 1577. He
had been captured near Probus; his wealthy
host, Francis Tregian, was attainted of
præmunire, and his children completely
beggared. This young Westcountryman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had a character all his own. He had been
charged with nothing but the exercise of
his priestly functions, and was offered his
life, on the day of his execution, if he would
but swear that the Queen was Supreme
Head of the Church of England. “Upon
this,” continues the chronicle, “he took the
Bible into his hands, made the sign of the
Cross upon it, kissed it, and said: ‘The
Queen neither ever was, nor is, nor ever
shall be, the Head of the Church of England!’”
Campion had only recently heard
the news in the August of 1579. One can
read between the lines of a passage like
this: “We all thank you much for your
account of Cuthbert’s martyrdom; it gave
many of us a divine pleasure. Wretch that
I am, how far has that novice distanced
me! May he be favourable to his old
friend and tutor! Now shall I boast of
these titles more than ever before.” Within
the next six months Edmund Campion
was to see the beginning of his heart’s
desire.</p>

<p>Dr. Allen, the founder of Douay, was in
Rome to organize the English College; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
there he brought all his persuasion to bear
upon the General of the Society of Jesus
and his consultors, that the English Jesuits
might be allowed to join the English
secular priests in the pressing redemption
of their distracted country. There were the
gravest reasons for and against the proposal,
but the answer given to Dr. Allen
was that the Society would do its best to
supply missioners thenceforward, and that
Robert Parsons and Edmund Campion
should be sent first as forerunners of the
rest. Allen was naturally overjoyed. While
Mercœur, the Father-General, wrote officially
to Campion’s Superior at Prague,
Allen wrote a moving letter to Campion
himself: “My father, brother, son,” he
calls him, “make all haste and come, my
dearest Campion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from Prague to
Rome, and thence to our own England.”
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “God, in whose hands are the issues,
has at last granted that our own Campion,
with his extraordinary gifts of wisdom and
grace, shall be restored to us. Prepare
yourself, then, for a journey, for a work, for
a trial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The imaginations of Campion’s comrades
at Prague were touched to the quick by
the prospect opening before their happy
brother. One of these bore witness to the
fragrance of his own thoughts by painting
a garland of roses and lilies on the wall of
Campion’s little room, just at the bed’s
head. A white-haired Silesian, Father
James Gall, wrote in scroll fashion, by
night, over the outer door of that same
little room: “P[ater] Edmundus Campianus,
Martyr.” For such a romantic
irregularity the old saint was reprimanded.
He replied quite simply: “But I had to
do it!” Poor Campion, who was shy, had
seen both these things, before Campanus,
the sympathetic Rector, gave him his
marching orders to start at once for Rome.
“The Fathers do verily seem to suspect
something about me; I hope their suspicions
may come true!” he said. “God’s will
be done, not mine.” And then, adds that
first English biographer who so well knew
him and so much loved him: “Being
scarce able to hold tears for joy and tenderness
of heart, he went to his chamber, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
there upon his knees to God satisfied his
appetite of weeping and thanksgiving, and
offered himself to His divine disposition
without any exception or restraint: whether
it were to rack, cross-quartering, or any
other torment or death whatsoever.”</p>

<h2>VII<br />

<small>A LONG MARCH: ROME, GENEVA,
RHEIMS: 1580</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM Prague to Munich, and from
Munich to Innsbrück, Campion had
the distinguished and very friendly
company of Ferdinand, brother of the
reigning Duke of Bavaria. Afterwards he
went on alone on foot, as he was always
glad to do, as far as Padua. Here he took
horse for Rome, which he reached just before
Palm Sunday, April 5, 1580, coming
“in grave priest’s garb,” we are told,
“with long hair, after the fashion of Germany.”
He was informed by the Father-General
that he was to start for England
nine or ten days after Easter. Campion
begged “neither to be Superior of the expedition
nor to have anything to do with
the preparations,” and that during the fortnight
he might be free from all except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
necessary cares, in order to make a more
devotional entrance upon the life ahead of
him. “And the like did, for their part,
and had done, all the Lent before, those
other priests also of the English Seminary,”
says Parsons, speaking of many
seculars afterwards martyred, “that were
appointed by their Superiors to go with us
in this mission.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All these together
used such notable and extraordinary diligence
for preparing themselves well in the
sight of God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as was matter of edification
to all Rome.”</p>

<p>Rome was a most religious place at that
time, not only in its enduring associations,
but in the temper of the people. One in large
measure responsible for its spirit of penance
and prayer, and loving charity to the poor,
was then living at San Girolamo, opposite
the old English hospital, now turned into
a College: this was St. Philip Neri, the
most venerated and endearing figure in all
the great city. He knew the successive
little English bands; when he passed them
in the streets, cheerful St. Philip used to
smile tenderly, and give what must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
been to them a thrilling greeting: “‘Hail,
Little Flowers of Martyrdom!’” the opening
line of the Breviary Hymn for Holy
Innocents’ Day. Parsons and Campion,
and the secular clerics associated with them,
may have originated the custom of going
over to San Girolamo for a special fatherly
blessing before setting forth to almost certain
death. There is a tradition (mentioned
by Newman) that one of that company did
not care to seek St. Philip’s prayers,
and that afterwards he failed to persevere.
This is thought to be the lay student, John
Paschall, or Pascal, who was apparently of
an unstable disposition, and is known to
have forsworn the Faith, when his great
chance came to profess it.</p>

<p>The Pope, Gregory XIII, showed untiring
and fatherly interest in all the missionaries,
and their travelling funds were his personal
gift. He wept over them in bestowing his
parting benediction. Campion set out this
time with seven English priests, Ralph
Sherwin, a former Fellow of Exeter College,
among them; also with two lay
brothers, and two students. Others joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
them from Rheims and Louvain, some of
them advanced in years and well known.
The party adopted the novel and almost
daredevil fashion of going on foot; but,
mounted and riding privately in advance of
it, were its two eldest members. One was
the holy octogenarian Thomas Goldwell,
the Lord Bishop of St. Asaph, who had
been offered by Queen Mary a transfer to
the See of Oxford, and refused it. He was
destined to be the last survivor of the deposed
and scattered Catholic hierarchy in
England, who had all but one refused the
unheard-of Oath in 1559, and had all been
deprived of their Sees that same year.
Bishop Goldwell now, twenty years afterwards,
was one of two who were living;
and his colleague, Watson, Bishop of
Lincoln, was in prison. The other senior
missionary was his companion, Dr. Nicholas
Morton, Canon Penitentiary of St. Peter’s,
who had done something already towards
the making of English history. The first
little Jesuit group of three was commanded
by Fr. Robert Parsons, a born organizer,
a man of splendid resources, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
celebrated, and much loved and hated. For
convenience, as for safety, they all put on
secular dress. Campion, however, would
buy no new clothes, but arrayed himself in
an old buckram suit, with a shabby cloak.
When rallied on his highly inelegant appearance,
he remarked with the gay spirit
so like that of another “blissful martyr,”
Sir Thomas More, that a man going forth
to be hanged need trouble himself little
about the fashion!</p>

<p>The roads were bad beyond any modern
idea of badness, and it poured rain for the
first nine or ten days. Campion, the least
robust of the party, and the most poorly
clad, fell ill under such combined discomforts,
and while crossing the Apennines had
to be lifted into the saddle of one of the
very few horses which had been brought
along for the sake of the infirm. As soon
as he was well enough he resumed his daily
habit of saying Mass very early, and of
walking on, in the later morning hours, till
he was a mile ahead of the rest, to make
his meditation, read his Office, and say the
Litany of the Saints, before he should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
overtaken. He and his comrades planned
their spiritual life, day by day, with the
most careful regularity. Their talk was
always of souls: “the Harvest” was their
word for England, or else “the Warfare.”
In the chilly spring twilights Campion
would push on ahead again, “to make his
prayers alone, and utter his zealous affections
to his Saviour without being heard
or noted.”</p>

<div class='attrib'><a href="#Page_73">p 73.</a></div>
</div>

<p>The route lay through Siena, Florence,
Bologna. In the latter city there was a
week’s delay, due to an injury to Fr. Parsons’
leg. The band of twelve was entertained
by the Cardinal Archbishop of that
See, who was the historian of the Council
of Trent: Gabriel Paleotto. Like Avellanedo,
like many another Italian, Paleotto
loved the English. “Were he a born Englishman,
he could not love them more,”
wrote Agazzario to Allen, at that time when
the national temperament was much more
expressive and responsive than it is now.
At Milan, in the early part of May, the
future confessors and martyrs were to find
another and a greater, also “much affectioned”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
towards them, who received them
most hospitably, and even asked the English
College for other relays of guests in
the future. This was the great Archbishop,
St. Charles Borromeo. Bishop Goldwell,
who had passed through Milan days before
the walkers reached it, had been, in 1563,
Vicar-General to St. Charles, and would
have bespoken his interest in the little
party. The reverend host complimented
Ralph Sherwin by asking him to deliver a
sermon before him, and as for Campion,
he was required to discourse daily after
dinner. St. Charles himself, all the while,
whether vocal or silent, was acting upon the
pilgrims as a <i>Sursum corda</i>. “Without
saying a word, he preached to us sufficiently,”
says the ever-appreciative Parsons,
“and so we departed from him
greatly edified and exceedingly animated.”
How charming is the forgotten use of the
last word, meaning “souled,” or, as we
still say, “heartened,” “inspirited!” Such
indeed is the true function of the saints.</p>

<p>From Turin the little company made for
Mount Cenis, and young, middle-aged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
old lustily climbed it; and then among the
torrents and boulders of that glorious
scenery, they came down into Savoy. At
St. Jean Maurienne they found the roads
blocked by the Spanish soldiery, and at
Aiguebelle ran across other disturbances,
caused by the wars of religion raging in
the Dauphiné. As there was nothing to do
but abandon the direct route, they turned
aside and entered Geneva, the hotbed of
Calvinism, and the home of Theodore
Beza, the learned apostate who had succeeded
to Calvin’s leadership. There was
a close community of spirit between Geneva
and the English Reformation. However,
Switzerland, then as now, had liberal laws,
and any traveller, Catholic or Protestant,
was free to pass, unmolested though not
unquestioned, three days in the city. It
looks decidedly like an alloy of mischief on
the part of five of the English that they
went to call in a body on Beza! They
were admitted as far as the court by
Claudine, his stolen wife, whom they
had all heard of, and were not ill-pleased
to see. When the famous greybeard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
came out they managed, after passing
their compliments, to worry him with
some telling controversial shots. Campion
knew not how to be rude: but Sherwin
found amusement, ever afterwards, in remembering
how that honest fellow “Patrick”
stood and looked and talked, cap in
hand, “facing out” (such is Sherwin’s
shockingly boyish language in a private
letter), “the old doting heretical fool.”
The celebrity so described behaved rather
vaguely, and, in the course of nature, could
not have been sorry to see the last of his
besiegers, and of their wits, sharpened with
life in the open air. He bowed them out
with less abruptness than might have been
expected—indeed, with a certain show of
civility; and went back to his books. Later,
Sherwin and two other youngsters, in a
midnight discussion with some English
Protestant students, actually challenged
Beza and all Calvindom to a trial of theologies,
with the drastic proviso that the defeated
party should be burnt in the marketplace!
Meanwhile Campion, in the <i>rôle</i> of
“Patrick,” did his share of “facing out”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
other worthies in Geneva, besides finding
an old University friend there, who “used
him lovingly,” but reported that an alarm
had been raised, and encouraged the departure
of the paladins. These, halting on
a spur of the Jura before nightfall, with
Lake Leman spread beneath them, said
<i>Te Deum</i> together, that they were safely
out of the city. There seems to have been
a good deal of curiosity or bravado mingled
with their polemical zeal, and Campion’s
always tender conscience would have readily
accepted, if it did not suggest, a suitable
penance for the raid. So off they trudged
nine steep, contrite, extra miles (“extreme
troublesome,” we are told they were) to
the nearest shrine, that of St. Claude, over
the French border.</p>

<p>They entered Rheims the last day of
May, 1580, for in Rheims was the soul, if
not the body, of the College now driven,
partly for convenience, partly by force of
trouble, out of Douay. That College was
never re-formed: but the scholar-exiles
lived close together, up and down the street
still called <i>Rue des Anglais</i>. The travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were rapturously welcomed by all, especially
by the great Englishman whom the old
narrative quaintly calls “Mr. Dr. Allen,
the President.” Here at Rheims the venerable
Bishop of St. Asaph fell ill of a fever.
He was never again to cross the Channel.
By the time he had fairly recovered,
rumours of his movements had naturally
got abroad, and the Pope was unwilling to
imperil so important and precious a person.
While still a convalescent at Rheims, Goldwell
wrote to his Holiness in person,
begging him to listen to no objections, but
to anoint at once three or four new Bishops
to shepherd their own needy Church; and
he very touchingly assures the Holy Father,
knowing that the question of a fitting maintenance
for them would arise, that God had
so inclined the minds of all the English
priests whom he knew to put up with their
penniless and hunted daily lives, and the
vision of the gallows always before them,
that any of these, once consecrated, would
be entirely contented to go on as poorly as
he had gone heretofore, like a Bishop of
the Early Church. The application failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“Etiquette and routine prevailed,” says
Simpson, in summing up this incident.</p>

<p>In truth, it was not that good-will was
lacking. Nobody on the Catholic side believed
that the new sad order of things in
England was going to last, and consequently,
waiting and postponing in a matter
of this sort, could not seem the disastrous
mistake which it really was. The upshot,
in any case, was that the good Bishop was
recalled to Rome, and there died; and that
for thirty weary years the poor flock struggled
on without any qualified prelate to
supply their crying spiritual wants and hold
them together. Then the first provisional
leader, known as the Archpriest, was appointed,
and later came Vicars Apostolic.
When finally the longed-for mitres were
seen again in the land, they had been
absent too long. The nominal link snapped;
the great native tradition was broken; the
titles of the ancient Sees, given up, as if in
sleep, by their lineal heirs, were never reclaimed.
So far as surface connection goes,—and
it goes far indeed with people in
general, who neither reason nor read, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
get all their ideas from what they see and
hear, this was the most tragic loss which
could possibly have befallen the post-Reformation
Church. (The English Benedictines
kept the thread of their own
dynasty in their hands: but this did not
affect the Catholic body, and the lay interest.)
The stranger who could not destroy
the life and blessing of the firstborn has
had possession, for three centuries and a
half, by royal grant, of his home and of
his very name.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />

<small>INHOSPITABLE HOME: 1580</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM had
a wonderfully well-organized spy-system:
far superior, as Simpson remarks,
to the attempts of the Spaniards in
the same line. Therefore each of the missionaries
was cautioned to travel under a
name other than his own. Campion fell back
upon his beloved alias of “Mr. Patrick,” as
he had done for the brief visit to Geneva.
His friends made him drop it, as they neared
the Channel; being Irish, it was doubly dangerous,
since here at Rheims the home-goers
got their first tardy news of the so-called
Geraldine insurrection in Ireland, acted
upon in July, 1579, and crushed almost as
soon by the massacre at Smerwick in Kerry.
It had been nursed by European feeling
against Elizabeth’s policy in Flanders, and
her piracies on the high seas; and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
religious grudge found it a convenient opening.
Dr. Nicholas Sander, who was not a
Papal Legate, but stood none the less for
the Pope’s active good-will in the matter,
joined the expedition with James Fitzmaurice,
Spanish soldiers, Roman officers,
ships and supplies. That expedition did not,
as we know, dislodge Jezebel from her
throne, but it gave sufficient heartbreak to
our messengers of the Gospel of Peace, who
were now sure to be mixed up with it in the
popular mind. The situation was certainly
an awkward one. It gave unique plausibility
to Walsingham’s claim that (to quote
Fr. Pollen) “the preaching of the old Faith
was only a political propaganda.” Father
Robert Parsons faced the future, on behalf
of the rest, in the spirit of a brave man.
“Seeing that it lay not in our hands to
remedy the matter, our consciences being
clear, we resolved ourselves, with the
Apostle, ‘through evil report and good
report’ to go forward only with the spiritual
action we had in hand. And if God had
appointed that any of us should suffer in
England under a wrong title, as Himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
did upon the case of a malefactor, we should
lose nothing thereby, but rather gain with
Him who knew the truth, and Whom only
in this enterprise we desired to please.”</p>

<p>Danger was a spur and not a bridle to
Campion’s devoted will. But he began to
foresee little fruit from labours on his native
ground, with so much fierce misunderstanding
against him; and to fear that he had not
done well in so gladly laying down what
was, after all, steady and successful work in
Bohemia. With this buzzing scruple he
went to the President for advice. Allen replied
that the work in “Boemeland,” excellent
at all points as it had been, yet could
be done by any equally qualified person, or
“at least by two or three” such persons,
whereas in his own necessitous England
Campion would be given strength and grace
to supply for many men.</p>

<p>At Rheims, during his waiting-time,
Campion preached one of his famous sermons
to the students. It gave him a pathetic
pleasure to be complimented upon his ready
English, of which he had spoken little in
private, and not a word in public, for eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
years. His text is reported to have been
Luke xii. 49: “I am come to send fire upon
the earth; and what will I but that it shall
be kindled?” and at one point he cried out
in so earnest a manner: “Fire, fire, fire,
fire!” that those outside the Chapel ran for
the water-buckets! But a careful reading
of what was then spoken suggests quite a
different passage of Holy Scripture as present
in Campion’s mind. His theme was
the ruin wrought by the conflagration of
heresy, now attacking a third generation of
Christian souls, and to be put out, he says,
by “water of Catholic doctrine, milk of
sweet and holy conversation, blood of potent
martyrdom.” Isaiah lxiv. 11, runs: “Our
holy and our beautiful house where our
fathers praised Thee, is burned up with fire;
and all our pleasant things are laid waste.”
This very passage had been alluded to in
one of Campion’s former exhortations, and
may have been a favourite with him. The
whole trend, indeed, and every part of this
Rheims sermon bear out the thoughts not
of the Apostle’s page, but of the Prophet’s.</p>

<p>Bishop Goldwell and Dr. Morton, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
highest in office of the missionary party, remained
at Rheims. Three Englishmen, a lay
Professor of Law, and two priests, joined in,
to fill up the gap, then another Jesuit, who
had been labouring in Poland: this was Fr.
Thomas Cottam, ordered home to restore his
health, but destined, as were so many of his
comrades, for martyrdom. The little band
of fifteen divided, and sailed from different
ports: Campion, with Parsons and one lay
brother, Ralph Emerson, headed for Calais
as their point of departure, going by way of
St. Omers, “not a little encouraged to think
that the first mission of St. Augustine and
his fellows into [our] island was by that
city.” Here there was another Jesuit College.
The Flemish Fathers croaked friendly
warnings in their ears, for it was common
rumour in St. Omers that the Queen’s
Council had full information of the appearance,
dress and movements of the exiles,
and had officers posted to waylay them on
arrival. They had come on foot nearly nine
hundred miles, and were not likely to give
up the object of their journey. But they
took precautions. It was decided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Parsons should go first, in military attire,
accompanied from the Low Countries by a
good youth who passed as his man George;
and that if Parsons got safely to Dover, he
was to send for Campion and the faithful
little soul Ralph Emerson. An English
gentleman “living over seas for his conscience,”
brought Fr. Parsons his fine disguise:
nothing less than a Captain’s uniform
of buff leather, with gold lace, big
boots, sword, hat, plume, and all. Campion,
when he had gone, sat down to write to the
General of the Society about him, with his
inevitably pictorial touch. “Father Robert
sailed from Calais after midnight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They
got him up like a soldier: such a peacock!
such a swaggerer!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such duds, such a
glance, such a strut! A man must have a
sharp eye indeed,” he adds, “to catch any
glimpse of the holiness and modesty that
lurk there underneath it all.” He goes on to
explain how he is laying out money to buy
numerous and silly clothes “to dress up
myself and Ralph,” whereby “to cheat the
madness of this world.” Fr. Parsons, like
Campion himself in lesser <i>rôles</i>, must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
been a dramatic genius, for arriving at
Dover on the 12th of June, and falling into
the hands of the searcher, he so won him
over, by the mere swagger and strut aforementioned,
as not only to be passed without
inquiry, but to be helped to a horse to carry
him to Gravesend. Thereupon the Captain
was quick to bespeak the interest of so unexpectedly
polite a functionary in his friend
“Mr. Edmunds,” described as a jewel-merchant
lying at St. Omers; and he gave
the searcher a letter recommending London
as a good market, to be forwarded post-haste
to that gentleman, and to be shown to the
searcher again by “Mr. Edmunds” himself
when he came over. And by the reception
of that letter Campion learned that Fr.
Parsons was scot-free, and speeded on his
way.</p>

<p>On the Feast of his old College patron,
St. John the Baptist, “Mr. Edmunds,” followed
by Brother Ralph, his supposed servant,
boarded the vessel bound for Dover.
At daybreak they stepped ashore under the
white cliffs, and there kneeling a moment in
the shadow of a rock, Campion renewed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
offering of himself, without reserve or condition,
to the God of Hosts, for the dark
“warfare” which lay before him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dispositions of the
searcher (who evidently put in no appearance)
had undergone a forced change. He
and the Mayor of the town had been reprimanded
by the Council for letting Papists
slip through their nets. Moreover, there
had been furnished, by a spy, a detailed
description of Cardinal Allen’s brother, who
was about to pass through Dover on his way
to relatives in Lancashire; and as Gabriel
Allen and Edmund Campion looked very
much alike, our jewel-merchant found himself
instantly under arrest. With an accuracy
which he was not in the least aware of,
the Mayor charged him and the lay brother
of being “foes to the Queen’s religion and
friends to the old Faith; with sailing under
false names, and with returning for the purpose
of propagating Popery.” Campion
offered to swear that he was not Gabriel
Allen, but offered in vain. The Mayor held
a hasty conference, and ordered a mounted
guard to carry both prisoners up to Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Francis Walsingham and the Council. All
this time, Campion was praying to God for
deliverance, and earnestly begging St. John
the Baptist to intercede for himself and his
companion. They were waiting near the
closed door of a room. “Suddenly,”
wrote Campion himself long after, to the
Father-General, “suddenly cometh forth an
old man: God give him grace for his pains!
‘Well,’ quoth he, ‘it is agreed you shall
be dismissed: fare ye well.’” After which
the two Jesuits left without further notice
or opposition, and travelled as fast as ever
they could to London.</p>

<p>Fr. Parsons had reached the city not without
adventure, but without mishap, a fortnight
before. Yet as no word had been
received since from him, Campion had no
idea how to proceed or whither to go; nor
could he inquire without arousing suspicion.
Fortunately Parsons had given to some
watchful young Catholics a description of
the jewel-merchant and his man: Ralph
Emerson was easily recognizable on account
of his extremely short stature. Thus they
had hardly touched the wharf at the Hythe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
before a stranger, Thomas Jay, stepped to
the gangway, with a welcoming gesture,
saying: “Mr. Edmunds, give me your
hand: I stay here for you, to lead you to
your friends.” Under this guidance Campion
reached London and Chancery Lane,
where he was clothed and armed, and provided
with a horse. He must have been
astonished to learn under whose roof he was
so safe and so comfortable: for it was none
other than that of the chief pursuivant!
Here was, indeed, a case of the bird nesting
in the cannon’s mouth. St. Augustine
warns us that we are not to think that
ungodly men are kept in this world for
nothing, nor that God has no good purposes
of His own to fulfil through them.
One cause of the miraculous preservation of
the ancient Faith under Elizabeth lay in the
fact that many an official, high and low, of
that time-serving Government, was in the
pay of the Recusant gentry. A strange situation
it was, and by no means an infrequent
one, when some of these, brought before the
magistrates, would be discharged on the
assurance of the bought-over official that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
prisoner was “an honest gentleman”: thus
averting all suspicion from the latter for the
time being.</p>

<p>The band of lay Catholics, some of whom
Campion had known from boyhood, like
Henry Vaux and Richard Stanihurst, were
acting as friends, freely leagued together, as
occasion arose, for the helping of priests,
and the furthering of religion. Their time,
their thoughts, their self-sacrifice, their
purses, were at the service particularly of
the Jesuits, persons habitually being
described by Sir Walter Mildmay in the
Star Chamber as “lewd runagates,” “a
sort of hypocrites,” “a rabble of vagrant
friars.” The leader of them all, in his inspiring
zeal, though not highest in station,
was George Gilbert, a rich young squire
owning estates (which were confiscated in
the end) in Buckinghamshire and Suffolk.
He was a convert, a great rider and athlete,
dear to many; but in secret a lover of apostolic
poverty, living for others: in short, a
saint. He spent himself to the last breath
for the Faith as truly as if he had perished
at Tyburn Tree. In banishment, he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
served the same cause by his forethought
and his generosity in the use of such worldly
goods as were left to him: for he became
responsible, at Rome, for the series of paintings
of the English martyrdoms which gave
their chief historical standing to the Beatifications
of 1886. Thus Gilbert, living and
dead, was Blessed Edmund Campion’s
availing friend and lover.</p>

<h2>IX<br />

<small>SKIRMISHING: THE ENGLISH COUNTIES:
1580</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE devoted George Gilbert, his
fellowship of young men, and
those whom they gathered together,
met on the Feast of SS. Peter and
Paul, June 29, to hear, for the first time,
Fr. Campion preach. It was no easy task to
find a safe and suitable auditorium; but
Lord Paget, one of their own number, was
daring enough to hire from Lord Norreys
the hall of a great house in the neighbourhood
of Smithfield. All the servants and
porters were turned out for the occasion,
and gentlemen took their places. Within
a few days, however, rumours about Campion’s
sermon and about Campion were
flying over the city. There were a number
of spies about, instructed by the Council,
pretending to be lapsed Catholics or unsettled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Protestants, and trying hard to bag
such new and shining birds as the Jesuits;
but Campion had a friend at court who
warned him, and therefore held only private
conferences in friendly houses with those
whom he knew. The missionaries were
sent to strengthen the wills of the wavering
Catholics, and not primarily to make converts.
Personal dealings with would-be
converts were never attempted except as
supplementary to the action of the lay
helpers, who took all the soundings, and
gave any needful catechizing. When Parsons,
who had been away in the country,
got back to town, Mr. Henry Orton and
Fr. Robert Johnson had been tracked and
imprisoned, through Sledd, the apostate informer;
and it became plain to the rest of
the little band gathered about Parsons and
Campion that, for reasons immediate and
remote, both Fathers must be spirited
away. Each went mounted, with a companion,
Gervase Pierrepoint being Campion’s
guide; and at Hoxton, in July, the
priests parted for their separate fields of
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before that, however, there arrived as
a deputy to them, Mr. Thomas Pounde of
Belmont, the best-known, perhaps, of all
English prisoners for the Faith: he was
committed to gaol sixteen times and passed
thirty years in durance. Pounde had
managed to bribe the gaoler of the Marshalsea
to let him out for this short journey.
Most anxious for the good repute of the
Fathers, he rode post-haste to tell them that
enemies in London were spreading the report
that they had come over for political
purposes, and that if in the midst of their
apostolic work in the shires they should be
taken and executed, the Government would
be sure to issue pamphlets, as was its habit,
defaming their motives, and slandering the
Catholic body. Therefore he begged both
Jesuits to write “a vindication of their presence
and purpose in England,” which,
signed and sealed, might be given to the
public, if things came to the worst. The
certain accusation and its answer had been
debated before, in council, by many clergy,
who had contented themselves with agreeing
to swear, when called upon, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had no business whatever in hand but that
of religion. But Campion now drew up
his own document then and there at a
table, while the others were talking. In it,
he declares that “my charge is of free cost
to preach the Gospel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to cry alarm
spiritual;” that “matters of state are things
which appertain not to my vocation,” and
are “straitly forbid”: things “from which
I do gladly estrange and sequester my
thoughts.” And never thinking of himself,
but fired with confidence in his cause,
he goes on to beg leave for a public presentment
of the Faith. He says, in the
course of this splendid little philippic: “I
should be loath to speak anything that
might sound of an insolent brag or challenge
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in this noble realm, my dear
country.” It shows completely the partisan
temper of the time that his statement got
exactly that name, and no other, fastened
upon it. It was called everywhere “Campion’s
Brag and Challenge,” and its
modest author was contemned and ridiculed
for the implication that his own powers
were so very superior that he must of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
course get the better of others in any
argument!</p>

<p>Pounde took his copy, which Campion
forgot to seal, back to London, read it in
raptures, let it be seen, admired, talked
about, and transcribed: this was his curious
way of keeping a secret. The result was
that what was meant to meet a particular
crisis, and serve for a last will and testament,
became as common property, beforehand,
as any ballad sold in the streets.
Lively measures were at once taken by the
Bishop of Winchester; and the State, hypocritically
urging “conspiracy,” pounced
upon a host of Catholic lords and gentlemen.
Yet Campion’s little composition,
which bred all this fury, only asks for
“three sorts of indifferent and quiet
audience”: one hearing before the Lords
in Council, on the relation of the Church to
the English Government; the next before
the Heads of Houses of both Universities,
on the proofs of the truth of the Catholic
religion; the last before the courts spiritual
and temporal, “wherein I will justify the
said Faith by the common wisdom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
laws standing.” Then he pleads in deferent
and almost affectionate words, for a
special audience of “her noble Grace” the
Queen. In his candour and fearless simplicity
he believed that opponents had only
to hear to be convinced, thus crediting them
with that earnestness in religious matters
which he possessed himself, and which only
a very few of the best Protestants of that
day shared with him. Campion closes his
appeal with a wonderfully beautiful reference
to the vowed Seminarian priests, and
in a lofty music of good English, worthy
to stand by any passage of like length in
the great prose classics. “Hearken to
those which spend the best blood in their
bodies for your salvation. Many innocent
hands are lifted up unto Heaven for you,
daily and hourly, by those English students
whose posterity shall not die, which,
beyond the seas, gathering virtue and
sufficient knowledge for the purpose, are
determined never to give you over, but
either to win you to Heaven or to die upon
your pikes. And touching our Society, be
it known unto you that we have made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
league (all the Jesuits in the world, whose
succession and multitude must overreach
all the practices of England!) cheerfully to
carry the cross that you shall lay upon us,
and never to despair your recovery while
we have a man left to enjoy your Tyburn,
or to be racked with your torments, or to
be consumed with your prisons. The expense
is reckoned; the enterprise is begun;
it is of God: it cannot be withstood. So
the Faith was planted. So it must be restored.
If these my offers be refused, and
my endeavours can take no place, and I,
having run thousands of miles to do you
good, shall be rewarded with rigour, I have
no more to say, but recommend your case
and mine to Almighty God, the Searcher
of Hearts: Who send us of His grace, and
set us at accord before the Day of Payment,
to the intent we may at last be friends
in Heaven, where all injuries shall be forgotten.”</p>

<p>Parsons’ work lay in Gloucester, Hereford,
Worcestershire, Warwickshire and
Derbyshire; Campion’s in the more
southerly Midlands. The wandering Levite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with his attendant gentleman would approach
at evening, and with caution, the
friendly roof, either Catholic or, though
Protestant, containing Catholics, and be
received at the door as strangers, then conducted
to an inner room, where all who
seek the priest’s ministrations kneel and
ask for his blessing. That night all is got
ready, and confessions are heard, instructions
given, reconciliations effected; at
dawn there is Mass, preaching, and Holy
Communion; and the travellers depart for
the next household station. Most edifying
accounts are given of the devotion of good
married Confessors, who were scattered all
over the land. The Jesuits met with many
seculars, “whom we find in every place,
whereby both the people is well served, and
we much eased in our charge.” These
were the old Marian priests, active in obscurity.
The “harvest is wonderful great”:
so many show “a conscience pure, a
courage invincible, zeal incredible, a work
so worthy; the number innumerable, of
high degree, of mean calling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of every
age and sex.” “The solaces that are ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
intermingled with the miseries are so great
that they do not only countervail the fear
of what punishment temporal soever, but
by infinite sweetness make all worldly pains,
be they never so great, seem nothing,” for
the sake of “this good people which had
lived before, so many ages, in one only
Faith.” Day by day, running in and out
of all the busy heroic toil, is the fiery thread
of danger and alarm. “We are sitting
merrily at table, conversing familiarly on
matters of faith and devotion (for our talk
is generally of such things) when comes a
hurried knock at the door.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We all
start up and listen, like deer when they
hear the huntsman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If it is nothing,
we laugh at our fright.” Then there was
calumny, a far more difficult thing to accept
in the same gay spirit. “They tear and
sting us with their venomous tongues, calling
us seditious, hypocrites; yea, heretics,
too! which is much laughed at. The
people hereupon is ours.” And again:
“The house where I am is sad: no other
talk but of the death, flight, prison, or
spoil of their friends; nevertheless, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
proceed with courage. Very many, even at
this present, being restored to the Church,
new soldiers give in their names, while the
old offer up their blood, by which holy
hosts and oblations God will be pleased.
And we shall—no question!—by Him overcome.”
These are extracts from Campion’s
letters, and give a clear idea of his life
during his visitations of 1580-1.</p>

<p>There were then many more Manor-houses,
kept up as such, than there are now;
most of those which Campion visited had
their hiding-place or “priests’ hole,” to
which he could always fly when safety demanded
it. He settled a host of weak
Catholics in their religion, and also received
a great many conspicuous converts. It will
be noted that the little Jesuit mission was
directed to the gentry. This was not
through accident, or partiality, or snobbery.
The gentry had most personal weight; they
were better able to protect a hunted man;
and they were naturally supposed to have
stricter notions of honour: this last was
a point on which everything depended.
Moreover, the old spirit of feudalism was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
not so dead but that through them all workmen
on their estates, or connected by interest
with them in the towns, could be reached
and influenced. In a hurried campaign,
every consideration of prudence and forethought
would choose them, so to speak,
as the outworks of the citadel.</p>

<p>The country districts north and south were
all still favourable to Catholicism. London,
the University of Cambridge, and some
larger towns and seaports, especially in the
West, were half Puritan or Calvinistic,
half irreligious and indifferent. The ancient
Faith, as was well said by Sir Cuthbert
Sharpe, for the most part “still lay like
lees at the bottom of men’s hearts; and if
the vessel were ever so little stirred, came
to the top.” A thoughtful living writer
sums it up as his conclusion that England
would have resumed the Faith with a sigh
of relief, had it not been for the resentments
bred by the Catholic “plotters.” Considering
the frightful circumstances of the
body to which these men belonged, it is
putting too great a strain, perhaps, upon
human nature to expect smooth behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from every individual in it. The genuine
“plotters” were few. Against them stands
the passionate loyalty of our persecuted
minority, both all along, and in the one
great crisis. When the deliverer loomed
up in the shape of Philip’s Armada, blessed
and indulgenced like a crusade of old, where
were they, supposed to be so sick of Queen
and country? Hand in impoverished
pocket, strengthening the national defences;
cutlass on thigh, manning the English fleet.</p>

<h2>X<br />

<small>MANY LABOURS: AND A BOOK: 1580</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">CAMPION passed four months of pleasant
weather in hard and happy
work, moving about Northamptonshire,
Berkshire, Oxfordshire. Some lovely
little spiritual adventure starred his path,
and the paths of others, wherever he went.
He must have seen more than once, from
some hilly road afar off, even if he never
entered it,</p>

<p class="center">
“The towery City, branchy between towers,”<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">which was so dear to him to the last. In
October of this year, 1580, he was bidden
towards London as far as Uxbridge: farther
he could hardly come, without the gravest
peril, as the Privy Council were just issuing
their third warrant for the capture of
Jesuits. There he was joined by Fr.
Parsons and several other missionaries. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
conference was held: it was represented
that Norfolk and Lancashire were eager
to claim Fr. Campion’s ministrations, and
it was decided that he was to go to Lancashire,
preferable as being not only farther
from London and also “more affected to
the Catholic religion,” but as having better
private libraries. For they were now urging
Campion to write again: this time
something on the burning questions of the
day, aimed particularly at the Universities
(where his Challenge was still the staple of
daily talk), and therefore to be written in
Latin. We are not so sure, now-a-days,
that controversy does much good, but one
reason for that may be that we have few
Campions to carry it on. It is well to remember
that people then read nothing else,
except poetry! Campion’s work was his
famous <i>Decem Rationes Propositæ in
Causa Fidei</i>, or, as the title is given in its
only modern translation (1827), <i>Ten Reasons
for Renouncing the Protestant, and Embracing
the Catholic Religion</i>. At first
the author was for calling his thesis <i>Heresy
in Despair: De Hæresi Desperata</i>. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
counsellors agreed, amid laughter, that it
would be odd indeed to nail such a title as
that to the mast, when heresy was so powerful
and flourishing; but, according to Campion’s
own philosophy, there was no life
in an argument whose only premisses, as he
once said, are “curses, starvation, and the
rack.” Here we come back at once to his
root principle, which modern research so
fully justifies, in regard to the England of
his own day. A “gentleman saint” who
uttered many an ironic, but never a contemptuous
word, Campion could not be
persuaded that “the received religion” was
a genuine thing. He believed that temporal
interest alone led people to conform to the
new alterations and restrictions; that the
lay statesmen who were pushing things
through were concerned not with doctrine,
but only with negations of doctrine, and
that on the other side, nothing was so promising,
nothing so gloriously fruitful, as
persecutions and martyrdoms. First and
last, he had a strong dash of optimism. In
this spirit he began his last treatise, writing
it as best he could, depending on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
memory, and on such books as country
squires might have in their houses, and
putting it together in among the almost
incessant journeys, duties, fatigues and
alarms of the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The two Jesuit friends parted at Uxbridge,
“with the tenderness of heart which in
such a case and so dangerous a time may
be imagined.” Gervase Pierrepoint conveyed
Campion into Nottinghamshire to
spend Christmas at Thoresby, his home;
thence into Derbyshire, where one of the
young Tempests succeeded as guide; and
the gentleman who directed the Yorkshire
part of the journey reached in safety the
house of his own brother-in-law, Mr.
William Harrington of Mount St. John,
near Thirsk, where the Father was received
with open arms. Here he settled down for
less than a fortnight at his desk, among his
note-books, at peace. But to have him in
the house at all was to risk the contagion of
the things of God. The eldest of the large
family, a wild boy, his father’s namesake,
was quick to feel the spell of this most
attractive guest. “Not only his eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and fire,” says Fr. Henry More of Campion,
“but a certain hidden infused power,
made his words strike home.” Some of
these simple words of every day “struck
home” to the young William Harrington,
so that fourteen years afterwards he found
the palm-branch of martyrdom growing
green and fair for him on the public execution
ground. At this very time of Campion’s
visit, the Lent of 1581, there was
another lad of fourteen or fifteen, John
Pibush, running about the streets of Thirsk,
his native village, who may have gone to
Confession to the strange priest at the
Manor, and wondered at him, unknowing
that he, too, was sealed as a future holocaust
in the same immortal cause.</p>

<p>From Mount St. John, where he must
have tasted much natural happiness, Campion
travelled into Lancashire, under the
protection of a former pupil and his wife.
There he was affectionately welcomed and
cared for in each of eight great houses,
where himself and his spiritual conferences
were still a glowing tradition, sixty or
seventy years afterwards. He had to live,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
think, write, in a crowd. The local gentry
drove from great distances and slept in
barns, only to hear and see him once. At
Blainscough Hall, the seat of the Worthingtons,
the pursuivants would have discovered
him, where he was walking in the
open air, had it not been for the cleverness
and splendid presence of mind of a faithful
maidservant, standing hard by. She ran
up against him, in a pretended fit of temper,
and shoved him into a shallow pond! The
pursuivants, sent out by the terrible Huntingdon,
President of the North, to apprehend
a distinguished cleric and scholar,
naturally never gave that mud-covered
yokel a second glance.</p>

<p>Fr. Campion would have learned by now
the fate of most of the enthusiastic band who
had travelled in his company, from Rome or
Rheims to England, during the preceding
summer: five priests, including the lovable
gay-hearted Sherwin, were languishing in
cells and on the rack; Fr. Parsons, though
hunted, was free. Following a suggestion
of Campion’s, he set up a private printing
press, in order that the <i>Ten Reasons</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
other Catholic works of defensive controversy
might be issued as they were needed.
Publishing, like every other major industry
open to the Catholics, was outlawed; devotional
and doctrinal books had to be
brought out in this hole-and-corner fashion,
if at all. Another of those lay associates
of the mission, whose devotion and usefulness
had been proved at every point,
came forward to bear the brunt of the new
enterprise. The young Stephen Brinkley,
Bachelor of Civil Law, called by Parsons
“a gentleman of high attainments both in
literature and in virtue,” volunteered to become
manager and head compositor, and
amid many dramatic and exciting interruptions,
carried his task through. Machinery,
types, paper, and the rest were bought with
money supplied by the ever-helpful George
Gilbert. Brinkley himself, to avert suspicion,
had to buy horses for his workmen,
and attire them like persons of quality
whenever they went abroad. He quite
knew what he was risking. After him,
still another knight of letters in a far less
perilous field, offered himself in the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of Thomas Fitzherbert of Swynnerton, then
newly married (long afterwards a priest,
and Rector of the English College in
Rome). His not undelightful duty was to
verify the mass of references and authorities
quoted in the margins of Campion’s manuscript:
this he did in a scholarly way, satisfactory
to the scholarly author, who believed
in research, and liked nothing at
second-hand. Lastly, Parsons, as Campion’s
Superior, recalled him to London in
April or May to see the little volume
through the press, and cautioned him to
put up only at inns on the way, where
happily he might pass as “the gentleman
in the parlour.”</p>

<p>Thirty miles or so north of the great
city, Campion had one of his ever-recurring
narrow escapes. A spy, hungry for reward,
had dogged his steps on his way from
York. At a certain town not named, a
little boy who knew Campion by sight
overheard this man describing the Father
to a magistrate, and calling him “Jesuit,”
a word the child had never heard. He ran
straight to the tavern where the “Jesuit”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had put up and succeeded in finding him
and warning him! so the bird was safely
on the wing before the fowlers were in
sight.</p>

<p>Campion came to Westminster and
Whitefriars, and set to work, diligently as
ever. With Father Robert he had frequent
occasion to visit the Bellamys of Uxenden
Hall near Harrow, a family under whose
roof his old friend Richard Bristow had
died in the preceding autumn. Their later
adversities and annihilation were only too
typical of Catholic domestic history under
Elizabeth. Going to Harrow meant going
up the Edgware Road, and in the mouth
of that road, between waste lands (facing
the spot across the street where the Marble
Arch now stands), was the famous Tyburn
gallows. This particular one had been put
up new for Dr. Storey’s execution, ten
years before: it had three posts set in a
triangle, with connecting cross-bars at the
top. Once every week, without intermission,
batches of criminals perished there.
Even now, and with far greater frequency
afterwards, holy and innocent men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
women made up a large proportion of the
“criminals”; and remembering these dear
souls, and conscious that there he was to
follow them in confession of the King of
Martyrs, Campion would always solemnly
take off his hat and pause, in passing, to
salute Tyburn Tree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the quiet and seclusion of
Dame Cecily Stonor’s park, near Henley,
and in the attics which she bravely set
apart for the purpose, the <i>Decem Rationes</i>
got itself safely printed by Stephen Brinkley
and his seven honest men. Campion,
with fine bravado, dated it from “Cosmopolis”;
and the distribution of it was as
audacious as the dating. The first copies
bound, about four hundred in number, were
hurriedly stabbed, instead of stitched, in
time to go up for the Oxford commemoration,
June 27th of that year. The church of
St. Mary-the-Virgin was then used for all
the “Acts,” for the accommodation of
which, a century later, the Sheldonian
Theatre was built. When the company
entered St. Mary’s, the benches were found
littered with the “seditious” books. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
dedication was “to the studious Collegians
flourishing at Oxford and Cambridge,” and
the youths in question were just in the
humour to read them; and read them they
did, then and there, instead of attending to
the important annual function going on!
This rudeness bred protest, and protest
bred a lively scene. To understand it we
must recall that the undergraduate element
was then, by comparison, the conservative
element. Heads of Houses, Fellows and
Tutors, learned and popular men, had been
removed wholesale by the Elizabethan
settlement of religion in favour of new men
concisely described as “extremists from
Geneva, intellectually inferior to those who
had been displaced, and representing a
different spirit, and different traditions.”
The student body looked on them with
scorn. Again, to quote another chief
authority on this subject, “the young
Oxonians did not bear easily the Elizabethan
drill, and felt that if their liberty
must be crushed they would fain have it
crushed by something more venerable than
the mushroom authority of the Ministers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the Queen. They were as tinder, and Campion’s
book was just the sort of spark to set
them in a blaze.” The excited Government
told off relays of clergymen to courtmartial
and shoot it. Aylmer, Bishop of
London, wished to commission nine Deans,
seven Archdeacons, and the two Regius
Professors of Divinity to punish the tiny
offender; but the actual ammunition brought
into the field was not quite so imposing as
all this. The answers were duly published,
dealing in the most unmeasured personal
abuse of Campion. No attempt was made
in any instance to rival either his religious
fervour or his literary grace. His last
labour with his pen made, in short, a very
great and an extremely prolonged stir.
Its fate was a romantic one from start to
finish, for it was so quickly and thoroughly
confiscated that not more than a couple of
copies are now known to exist. Despite the
outcry, or because of it, edition after edition
was called for. There have been nearly
thirty reprints in the original Latin, and
many translations into modern languages,
inclusive of three beautiful translations into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the good English common in 1606, 1632,
and 1687, one of which should be re-issued.
The <i>Ten Reasons</i>, written under such immense
difficulties, had all of Campion’s
zeal and pith, and was “a model of eloquence,
elegance, and good taste.” Marc
Antony Muret, the greatest Latinist of the
time, called it <i>libellum aureum</i>, “a golden
little book, writ by the very finger of God.”
Campion had gone, in his ardent, sensitive,
rhetorical, compendious way, over the whole
ground of the credentials of that Church
which had had the allegiance of England for
more than a thousand years: Scripture, the
Fathers, the Councils, the evidence of
human history, are all drawn upon, in the
best spirit of the new learning. The
characteristic note of personal appeal to the
Queen is not lacking here at the end.
Campion’s theme is the Church, and he
quotes from the Prophet Isaiah: “Kings
shall be thy nursing fathers, and Queens thy
nursing mothers;” and he names as among
the great monarchs whose joy it was to
further the Church in their day, St. Edward
the Confessor, St. Louis of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
St. Henry of Saxony, St. Wenceslaus of
Bohemia, St. Stephen of Hungary, and the
rest. Then he cries out to “Elizabeth,
most mighty Queen,” to listen. “For this
Prophet is speaking unto thee, is teaching
thee thy duty. I tell thee one Heaven cannot
gather in Calvin and these thine ancestors.
Join thyself therefore to them,
else shalt thou stand unworthy of that name
of thine, thy genius, thy learning, thy
fame before all men, and thy fortunes. To
this end do I conspire, and will conspire,
against thee, whatever betideth me, who am
so often menaced with the gallows as a conspirator
hostile to thy life. (‘All hail, thou
good Cross!’) The day shall come, O
Elizabeth! the day that shall make it altogether
clear which of the two did love thee
best: the Company of Jesus, or the brood
of Luther!”</p>

<p>Hardly was the last of the original imprints
bound and distributed, when the pursuivants
in search of what was roughly, but
significantly enough, called “Massing-stuff,”
pounced upon Stonor Park, and
caught red-handed there, and carried off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the two gentlemen, John Stonor and
Stephen Brinkley, and four of the printers,
one of whom, a poor frightened fellow,
conformed, and was let off at once.
William Hartley, ordained the year before,
who had in person strewn the <i>Ten Reasons</i>
over the benches of the University Church,
and made special gifts of copies in various
Colleges, was arrested a little later. His
fate was not exceptional, like that of his
comrades just mentioned, who were eventually
released on bail. He suffered at
Tyburn; and his mother, heroic as the
mother of the Macchabees, stood by his
young body in its butchering, and thanked
God aloud for her privilege in so giving
back to Him such a son.</p>

<p>Campion spent St. John’s Day (marking
the first anniversary of his return to England)
at Lady Babington’s, at Twyford in
Buckinghamshire, a house not many miles
from Stonor, on the other bank of the
Thames. He stayed a little while at Bledlow
also, and at Wynge, with the Dormers,
his whole heart bent, every moment of the
time, upon his Father’s business. But his
free days were almost done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The outcry redoubled, now that he had
again succeeded in catching public attention.
Fresh and monstrously cruel measures
were therefore taken against all Papists.
“Naught is lacking,” wrote to Acquaviva
the tender soul who too well knew himself
to be the cause of many sorrows, “but that
to our books written with ink should succeed
others daily published, and written in
blood.” Fr. Parsons prudently ordered
him back to the North. The two heard
each other’s confessions and renewal of
vows at Stonor, and said good-bye, exchanging
hats as a parting gift, after the
friendly fashion of their time. Campion
was to ride straightway into Lancashire to
get his manuscript and notes, left behind,
his former companion Ralph Emerson going
with him; and he was then to betake
himself to the fresh mission field in Norfolk.
As it fell out, he soon spurred back
after Parsons to tell him of a letter that
moment received. It was from a gentleman
named Yate, then a prisoner for his
religion, earnestly begging Campion to
visit Lyford Grange in Berkshire, the
gentleman’s own estate, hard by, where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wife and mother still were, together with
Edward Yate, and part of a proscribed community
of English Brigittine nuns, driven
back into England by troubles in the Low
Countries. Fr. Parsons, knowing the house
to be a conspicuous one, and already supplied
with chaplains, was unwilling to
grant the permission. But eventually he
gave in, warning the two others not to
tarry beyond one night or one day, and as
a precaution, putting Campion under the
lay brother’s care and obedience. Parsons
parted from him not without a rueful and
affectionate word. “You are too easy-going
by far,” he said to his friend and
fellow-soldier, purposely giving its least
heroic name to that intentionally prodigal
zeal for souls. “I know you, Father Edmund;
if they once get you there, you will
never break away!”</p>

<h2>XI<br />

<small>AT LYFORD GRANGE, AND AFTER: 1581</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning of July 12, Father
Edmund and Brother Ralph, faithful
to agreement, were in their
saddles again, leaving the pious household
refreshed, but lamenting. Of the two priests
who formed part of it, one, Fr. Collington,
or Colleton, escorted them some distance on
their way. Campion had already been waylaid,
at an inn near Oxford, by many friendly
tutors and undergraduates, when up galloped
the other chaplain of Lyford, Fr.
Forde. He was a Trinity College man, who
had entered Douay just after Campion’s
arrival there, and was to follow him closely
to martyrdom. Forde brought news that a
large party of Catholics had come over to
Lyford to visit the nuns, and, distressed at
missing Fr. Campion, were clamouring for
his return. The Oxford group had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
begging their old champion to preach to
them, which he would not do in so public a
place; they now added their entreaties to those
of the deputy of the strangers, and offered to
join these at Lyford. Surely, he who had
given a whole day to a few godly nuns, who
needed him but little, could not refuse a
Saturday and Sunday to so many soiled
souls of every stripe and colour, “thirsting
for the waters of life”? The suit was insistent;
Campion was inclined to give in,
but referred his admirers to Brother Emerson,
as his provisional Superior. He, in
turn, was overborne. It seemed much safer,
after all, for the precious Father to be
among friends, while he, Ralph, went on
alone to fetch the books from Mr. Richard
Houghton’s in Lancashire. So back to
Lyford Campion went, to the poor little
lay brother’s everlasting regret.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday morning, the
ninth after Pentecost, Campion preached at
the Grange on the gospel of the day, the
peculiarly touching gospel of Jesus weeping
over Jerusalem, the changed and faithless
city which stoned the prophets, and knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not, in her day, the things that were to her
peace. No one present ever forgot that
heart-shaking sermon, laden as it was with
pathos and presentiment. There was an
audience of sixty, including the Oxonians.
Unfortunately it included also George
Eliot, a man of the most evil personal repute,
an apostate and a Government spy,
armed with plenary powers. He was then
under a charge of murder, and was anxious
to whitewash himself in the eyes of the
Council by some conspicuous public service.
He had once been a servant of the Ropers at
Canterbury; and Mrs. Yate’s honest cook,
who had known Eliot there in his decent
days, let him in without question, whispering
what a treat was in store for him in the
preaching of none other than Father Campion!
Though the warrant for the apprehension
of the Jesuit was in Eliot’s pocket,
he little thought to capture him so easily
and so soon. A pursuivant had accompanied
him to the gate; Eliot went back to
this person, nominally to dismiss him, as a
heretic, really to speed him to a magistrate
at Abingdon for a force of an hundred men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to arrest Campion in the Queen’s name.
Then he went piously up-stairs to Mass,
Edmund Campion’s last Mass, so far as we
know. That, and the sermon, passed by in
peace, and Eliot himself left. Immediately
after dinner an alarm was given by a
watchman posted in a turret, who saw the
enemy far off. Campion sprang up, and
started to leave at once, and alone, saying
that his chances of escape might be fair, and
that his remaining would only involve the
household in discomfort and danger. But
they all clung to him, assuring him that
Lyford was full of cunning secret passages
and hiding-holes; and into one of these, in
the wall above the gateway, he was forthwith
hurried by Forde and Collington, who
laid themselves down by his side, and
crossed their hands over their breasts.</p>

<p>Back came Eliot with the magistrate, a
civil squire, and the neighbourly Berkshire
yeomen who loathed the work. He made
them turn the whole house topsy-turvy, nor
desist till evenfall; then, finding nothing,
they withdrew. However, they returned
almost in the same breath, egged on by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Eliot, who now would have the walls
sounded. The Abingdon magistrate apologized
to Mrs. Yate, not for the Queen’s
warrant, but for his associate, “the mad-man,”
as he called him, who was carrying
it out. The lady was an invalid; thinking
not altogether of herself, she railed and
wept. The magistrate kindly soothed her
fears, and allowed her to sleep where she
pleased, undisturbed by his men and their
din. She chose to have a bed made up
close to the hiding-place. She was conducted
thither with the honours of war,
and a sentinel was posted at the room door.
The tapping and smashing went merrily on
elsewhere until late at night, when, by her
orders, the sheriff’s baffled underlings made
a fine supper, and being worn out, fell asleep
over their cups, even as they were expected
to do. Poor Mrs. Yate was either by nature
the silliest of women, or else her nerves were
upset by illness and trying circumstance,
for she sent for Fr. Campion, as well as for
all her other guests who were in that part of
the house, and requested him, as he stood
by her bedside—of all possible things—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
preach to them just once more! One could
not in courtesy refuse a hostess, however
unreasonable, who was risking so much for
him; nor would it have been like him to
refuse. Allen tells us that it was his invariable
habit to preach “once a day at the
least, often twice, and sometimes thrice,
whereby through God’s goodness he converted
sundry in most shires of this realm
of most wisdom and worship, besides young
gentlemen students, and others of all sorts.”</p>

<p>Fr. Campion discharged his task. As the
little congregation broke up, some one
stumbled in the dark, and several fell; the
snoring sentinel awoke; searchers, with
lanterns and axes, swarmed up from below.
There was nothing to be seen: Lyford was
not honeycombed in vain with hidden passages.
The men-at-arms had been fooled too
often, and were angry with Eliot. Yet that
functionary knew that something was still
really afoot, that the alarm was not a false one.
On going down the stairs again he struck his
hand upon the wall over it. “We have not
broken through here!” he said. A loyal
servant of the Yates, who was at his side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and who knew it was just there the refugees
lay, muttered that enough wall had been
ruined already, and then went deadly pale
while Eliot’s eye was still on him. The
latter called, in triumph, for a smith’s
hammer, and banged it into the thin timber
partition, and into the narrow cell. And
thus was Father Edmund Campion taken at
Lyford Grange, at dawn of Monday, July
17th, in the year 1581.</p>

<p>He was quite calm, quite cheerful. With
him were apprehended the two priests, seven
gentlemen, and two yeomen. Forster, the
Sheriff of Berkshire, hitherto absent,
arrived. As he was an Oxonian, and almost
a Catholic, and kindly disposed towards
Campion, he waited to hear from the
Council what was to be done. On the fourth
day orders came to send the chief prisoners
up to London, under a strong guard. Leaving
the old moated house and its many occupants,
now distracted with grief, Campion
took horse at the door, and rode slowly off,
Eliot prancing in triumph at the head of
the company, though the common people
saluted him as “Judas,” all along the way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The first halt was at Abingdon; sympathetic
Oxford scholars had come down to see the
last of the great light of the University
under such black eclipse. Eliot accosted his
victim at table: “Mr. Campion, I know
well you are wroth with me for this work!”
He drew out a beautiful answer, sincere,
composed, half-playful: a saint’s answer.
“Nay, I forgive thee; and in token thereof,
I drink to thee. Yea, and if thou wilt repent,
and come to Confession, I will absolve thee:
but large penance thou must have!” At
Henley, Campion saw in the crowd Fr.
Parsons’ servant, and greeted him as he
could, without betraying him: Fr. Parsons
was near at hand, but was wisely kept indoors.
A young priest, “Mr. Filby the
younger,” as he was called, a native of
Oxford, is said to have here attempted to
speak to Campion; he was at once seized
upon as a traitorous “comforter of Jesuits,”
and added to the cavalcade. At Colebrook,
less than a dozen miles from London,
came fresh instructions from the Council.
Sheriff Forster had treated his prisoners
most honourably: they were now to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a public show. Their elbows were tied from
behind, their wrists roped together in front,
and their feet fastened under the horses;
their leader was decorated with a paper
pinned to his hat—Fr. Parsons’ hat of late—on
which in large lettering was inscribed:
“Campion, the Seditious Jesuit.” And in
this guise he was paraded through the chief
streets of the great city on market-day. The
mob roared with delight; “but the wiser
sort,” says Holinshed, “lamented to see the
land fallen to such barbarism as to abuse in
this manner a gentleman famous throughout
Europe for his scholarship and his
innocency of life, and this before any trial,
or any proof against him, his case being
prejudged, and he punished as if already
condemned.” Stephen Brinkley somehow
obtained, as a souvenir of a fellow-prisoner,
that thick dark felt hat, which had been
so ignominiously labelled in the cause of
Christ. Years afterwards, when in Belgium,
he put it into a reliquary, “out of love and
veneration towards that most holy martyr of
God, his father and patron.” A piece of it
is at Roehampton, in the Jesuit Noviciate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the Tower the Lyford captives
were given up to the Governor, Sir
Owen Hopton. Taking his cue, he had
Campion thrust at once into Little Ease, the
famous Tower hole not high enough for a
man to stand upright in, nor long enough
for him to lie down in. After four days of
this misery he was suddenly taken out, put
in a boat at the Traitors’ Gate steps, and
rowed to the town house of the Earl of Leicester.
This nobleman and Edmund Campion,
who had seen so much of each other for
several years, had been placed by events in
silent conflict. There stood the Earl of Bedford,
with two Secretaries of State; there
stood Campion’s host, who, for one reason or
another, had never hounded Catholics with
the fixed fury of Walsingham and Burghley,
and thereby did not displease his irresolute
royal mistress; there (a theatrical circumstance!)
was that royal mistress herself, a
gleaming stately vision in a great chair,
head and front of a not unfriendly little inquisition.
To the questions heaped upon
him Campion gave frank answers. On the
matter of “allegiance” he seemed to satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the company, who told him there was no
fault in him save that he was a Papist.
“That,” he modestly interrupted, “is my
greatest glory.” The Queen smiled upon
him, and offered him liberty and honours,
but under conditions which his conscience
forbade him to accept.</p>

<p>When he was courteously dismissed,
Leicester, probably with a kind motive, sent
a message to Hopton to keep up the flatteries
of the new policy. Hopton put on an almost
affectionate consideration for his important
prisoner; and so fast as he was prompted,
by artful degrees, he suggested to him a
pension, a high place at Court, and even the
promise eventually of the mitre and revenues
of the primatial See of Canterbury! Well
did the Council know, all along, the value
of these stubborn and unpurchasable confessors
of Christ. To cap the matter, in
Campion’s case, it was publicly announced,
both by Hopton and by Walsingham (who
knew the untruth of their announcement),
that the Jesuit was at the point of recantation
and Protestant orthodoxy, and in full
sight of the future Archbishopric, “to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
great content of the Queen.” It flew all over
London that he would presently preach at
Paul’s Cross, and there burn the <i>Decem
Rationes</i> with his own hand. Eventually
Hopton returned to first principles indoors,
and inquired point-blank of Campion
whether he would give up his religion, and
conform. The reply is easily imagined. A
continued course of wheedling was wasteful
business. So thought the Council; and three
days after his strange and sudden sight of
the Queen’s Grace at Leicester House,
Edmund Campion, first kneeling down at
the door and invoking the Holy Name for
steadying of his manhood, was stripped and
fastened to the rollers of the Tower rack.
Blandishments had failed to move him; they
would try mortal pain, and see what that
could do. Torture, nevertheless, was as
much against the laws of England then
(though not against the laws of some less
humane countries), as it is now.</p>

<h2>XII<br />

<small>THE THICK OF THE FRAY: 1581</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">CAMPION, in between the working
of the rollers, was asked his opinion
of certain political utterances in the
works of his old friends Allen and Bristow,
and of Dr. Sander; also whether he considered
the Queen “true and lawful,” or
“pretensed and deprived.” He refused to
answer. Physical anguish could be little
worse than the ineffable boredom of these
two never-quiet questions. He was then
asked by the Governor, the Rackmaster,
and others present, by whose command and
counsel he had returned to England; by
whom in England he had been received and
befriended; in whose houses he had said
Mass, heard Confessions, and reconciled
persons to his Church; where his recent
book was printed, and to whom copies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
given; lastly, what was his opinion of the
Bull of Pius V against Queen Elizabeth?
A letter written at the time to Lord Shrewsbury
by Lord Burghley, and still extant,
shows that nothing of moment could be got
out of Campion. During the next fortnight,
however, there was poured into the
ear of the Government information regarding
the second and third items in the above
category. Houses were searched; persons
of mark were apprehended, tried in the Star
Chamber, and sentenced. Almost every
manse or town house where Campion had
been harboured became known, and even
the names of those Oxford Masters of Arts
who had followed him to Lyford. The
Government gave out that he had confessed
upon the rack, and implicated his
too trusting friends. The alleged facts
naturally became a general scandal, and
bred grief and horror among the Catholics
who, no less than Protestants, were thus
driven to believe them. The secrets were
probably given up, under panic, by three
serving-men, and by poor Gervase Pierrepoint.
It was a common trick of the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
though not peculiar to it, to show a prisoner
a lying list of names purporting to have
been extracted from colleagues, so that he
himself might be trapped into endorsing
the suspicions held in regard to those
names. But it is clear that Campion was
brought to mention only a few who, as he
was aware, were formerly known to his
examiners as Catholic Recusants; and only
after a solemn oath from the Commissioners
that no harm could accrue to them in
consequence of such supplementary mention.
Even this he had every cause to
regret. The gentlemen and gentlewomen
on Lord Burghley’s lists were carefully informed,
when arrested, that it was Campion
who had betrayed them: a cruel slander
which he could refute only at the foot of the
scaffold. Thanks to the reports, first of his
backsliding, then of his treachery, his great
reputation, for the time being, was clean
gone. Having thus been given forth to the
public as a knave, he was now to be set
before them as a fool, and shown to be one
who possessed neither sort of superiority,
moral or mental.</p>

</div>

<p>Many courtiers, having a purely artistic
interest in Edmund Campion, had begged
that he might obtain the chance he had
often asked for, of being heard in a disputation.
This request was now suddenly
granted. The conference was public, and
came off in the Norman Chapel of the
Tower, which was crowded. Two Deans,
Nowell of St. Paul’s, and Day of Windsor,
were appointed to attack Campion; he was
to answer all objections as he could, but
was forbidden to raise any of his own.
Charke, the bitter Puritan preacher of
Gray’s Inn, and Whitaker, the Regius Professor
of Divinity in Cambridge, were the
notaries. The lion to be baited did not
even know that there was to be a conference,
until he was brought to it under a strong
guard. Time for preparation had been
denied him; he was allowed the use of only
such authorities as his memory could furnish;
pale and weary and rack-worn as he
was, he was given only a low stool to sit
upon. The well-fed theological worthies
were ranged before him, their chairs standing
on raised platforms, and their tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
spread with books of reference, pens and
paper.</p>

<p>One who was there tells us how easy and
ready were his answers; how modest his
mien; how that high-spirited nature so bore
the scorn, the abuse, and the jests heaped
upon him, as to win great admiration from
the majority of those who heard him for
the first time. He began by asking very
pertinently whether this was a just answer
to his challenge, first to rack him, then to
deprive him of books, notes and pen, lastly,
to call upon him to debate? and he added
(wishing to be fully understood by the audience),
that what he had asked for was quite
another sort of hearing: a hearing under
equal conditions before the Universities.
During the course of this first conference he
was twice most unfairly tripped up: once
over a quotation, in which he was right,
though he could not then and there prove
it; and again over a page of the Greek
Testament, in such small type that he
could not read it, and had to put it by when
it was handed to him: thereby drawing
down upon himself the ridiculous taunt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
he knew no Greek. This he took silently,
and with a smile. At the end of the six
hours he had more than stood his ground.
The Deans complained afterwards that a
number of gentlemen present, “neither unlearned
nor ill-affected,” considered that
Master Campion had the best of it. Some
common people who thought so too, and
said so in the streets, paid dearly for their
boldness. One of these gentlemen favourably
impressed was Philip, Earl of Arundel,
then in the flush of worldly pride and
pleasure. He was the real victory of the
Jesuit apostle, for he received at that time
and in that place the first ray of divine
grace, strong enough to change gradually
in him the whole motive and course of that
intensity of life which never failed the
Howards. As he stood leaning forward in
the foreground of the daïs, in that solemn
interior, tall and young, with his great
ruff and embroidered doublet, and his
brilliant dark eyes held by the pathetic
figure of Master Campion, how little could
he have foreseen his own weary term of
suffering in that gloomy fortress, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
sainted death there, at the end of the
years!</p>

<p>There were three other conferences under
like conditions, but in other quarters, with
four fresh adversaries. Campion was again
“appointed only to answer, never to oppose”;
that is, to answer miscellaneous and
disjointed objections against the Catholic
Church, without ever being allowed “to
build up any harmonious apology for his
own system.” The last conference was
notable for its browbeating and threatening
of a too successful adversary. The
Bishop of London privately came to the
conclusion that the verbal tournament was
doing no good whatever to the sacred cause
of Protestantism. The Council agreed,
and ended it.</p>

<p>Towards the end of October Campion
was racked for the third time, and with the
utmost severity, so that he thought they
meant, this time, to kill him; but his fortitude
was unshaken. A rough and honest
first cousin to the Queen, Henry Carey,
Lord Hunsdon, growled that it were easier
to pluck the heart out of Campion’s breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
than to wrest from him one word against
his conscience. His arms and legs went
quite numb after this final torture. The
keeper, who was won over by his endearing
prisoner, and was always as gentle with
him as he dared to be, inquired next day
how they felt. “Not ill,” said Father
Edmund, with all of his old brave brightness,
“not ill, because not at all!”</p>

<p>Never once until now had he been accused
of any conspiracy. But he was a troublesome
person: he must be silenced somehow.
With a tardy inspiration, the
Council bent all their strength to get out
of Campion some acknowledgment that he
had been mixed up with the Spanish-Roman
expedition, and the Irish rising of
the preceding year. Not a shadow of proof
could, of course, be produced for such a
charge. Then, as a final and sure means of
indicting him on some other count than
that of religion, and of urging his execution
upon the Queen, Walsingham, with
Burghley’s connivance, hatched a treasonable
plot out of his own inventive head,
and got false witnesses to accuse Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Campion of it, and swear his life away.
The “Plot of Rheims and Rome” was
described as an attempt to raise a sedition,
and dethrone and kill the Queen. It had
an imaginary but recent date: 1580.
Everybody or anybody, when found convenient,
could be accused of so elastic a
plot. It was first charged against some
twenty priests and laymen in this year
1581; but it was brought up against the
Earl of Arundel four years afterwards,
despite the fact that the supposed interests
of the Church were the last things likely to
win his attention at the time assigned.</p>

<p>On All Saints’ Day arrived in England
a suitor for the hand of Queen Elizabeth:
Francis, Duke of Alençon, King of the
Netherlands, the short-lived heir to the
throne of King Henry the Third of France.
With that King, while Duke of Anjou, and
with Alençon for nine years past (as for
three yet to come), Elizabeth had carried
on negotiations which ended in smoke; but
she now announced that she “would marry
at last.” Little Froggy, as she endearingly
called him, was ugly to a degree, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
many years younger than her Majesty;
he was brother-in-law to the Queen of
Scots, who was her Majesty’s prisoner at
Sheffield. The dominant, ultra-bigoted party
took extreme alarm at the near prospect of
toleration for Catholics which such a royal
match suggested to them. To reassure
them, it might just now be most useful,
thought the Council, to hang a Jesuit or two.</p>

<p>On the 14th of the month Campion and
eight others were arraigned before the
grand jury in Westminster Hall. For
“treasonable intents” of the Queen’s deprivation
and murder, these “secret and
privy practices of sinister devices,” befitting
one “led astray by the devil,” had
“Edmund Campion, clerk,” made his re-entry
into England, the Pope, meanwhile,
being not only aware of his act, but its
“author and onsetter”! He was commanded,
as were all those lumped with
him in a common accusation, to plead
Guilty or Not Guilty. Up went all the
right arms of these “devotaries, and dead
men to this world, who travelled only for
souls,” as Campion himself called them:
all but his, so disabled by the rack that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
could not stir it from the furred cuff in
which it lay. But a quick-witted comrade
turned and took off the cuff, “humbly kissing
the sacred hands so wrung for the confession
of Christ,” and lifted it high to cry
its own mute Not Guilty with the rest. The
Spanish Ambassador, Don Bernardino de
Mendoza, standing close by with his secretary,
saw, with a pang of pity, that all the
finger-nails were gone from Campion’s
swollen hands. The trial proper began on
the 20th, before “such a presence of people
of the more honourable, wise, learned, and
best sort as was never seen or heard of in
that court in ours or our fathers’ memories
before us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so wonderful an expectation
there was to see the end of this marvellous
tragedy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [of] such as they knew in
conscience to be innocent.” They all heard
Ralph Sherwin say, in a loud clear voice:
“The plain ground of our standing here is
religion, and not treason.”</p>

<p>Chief Justice Wray presided, a Catholic
at heart, and wretched ever after over this
unwilling day’s work. The prosecuting
officers for the Crown were the Queen’s
serjeant, Edmund Anderson; Popham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
afterwards Chief Justice; and Egerton,
afterwards the first Lord Ellesmere. The
chief witnesses were George Eliot, Anthony
Munday, and two creatures named Sledd
and Caddy: probably as evil a quartette as
existed in contemporary England, and
worthy forerunners of Oates and Bedloe.
“They had nothing left to swear by,” as
Campion reminded the jury: “neither religion
nor honesty.” In no special order,
but with much ardour and diligence, all
the old tiresome trivial accusations were
brought forward and pressed in, Campion
being spokesman throughout for the defence,
and his alert mind, despite his weakened
body, meeting them all, and routing
them. He was charged with having “seduced
the Queen’s subjects from their
allegiance” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and “reconciled them to
the Pope.” He caught up the word. “We
‘reconcile’ them to the Pope! Nay, then,
what reconciliation can there be to him,
since reconciliation is only due to God?
This word [‘reconcile’] soundeth not to a
lawyer’s usage, and therefore is wrested
against us inaptly. The reconciliation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
we endeavoured was only to God: as Peter
saith, <i>reconciliamini Domino</i>, be ye reconciled
unto the Lord.” Campion was informed:
“Yourself came as Procurator
from the Pope and Dr. Allen, to break these
matters to the English Papists.” So he
rejoined that in his homeward voyage from
Rome, undertaken by his vow of obedience
as a Jesuit, “the which accordingly I enterprised,
being commanded thereto,” he had
“dined with Dr. Allen at Rheims, with
whom also after dinner I walked in his
garden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and not one jot of our talk
glanced to the Crown or State of England.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
As to the [Pope], he flatly with charge
and commandment excused me from matters
of State and regiment.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Followed
a change of tactics. “Afterclaps make
those excuses but shadows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For what
meaning had that changing of your name?
Whereto belonged your disguising in apparel?
What pleasure had you to royst it
[in] a velvet hat and a feather, a buff leather
jerkin, and velvet venetians?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Can that
beseem a professed man of religion which
hardly becometh a layman of gravity? No:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
there was a further matter intended.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Had you come hither for love of your
country, you would never have wrought a
hugger-mugger; had your intent been to
have done well, you would never have
hated the light.” To which Campion replied
that St. Paul, in order “that living
he might benefit the Church more than
dying,” betook himself “to sundry shifts
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that especially the changing of his
name was very oft and familiar” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
that “he sometimes thought it expedient
to be hidden, lest, being discovered, persecution
should ensue thereby, and the gospel
be greatly forestalled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If these shifts
were then approved in Paul, why are they
now reproved in me?—he an Apostle, I a
Jesuit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the same cause common to us
both.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wished earnestly the planting of
the gospel; I knew a contrary religion professed;
I saw if I were known I should be
apprehended. I changed my name, I kept
secretly: I imitated Paul. Was I therein
a traitor?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The wearing of a buff jerkin,
a velvet hat, and suchlike, is much forced
against me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not indicted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Statute of Apparel!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Indeed, I acknowledge
an offence to Godwards for so doing,
and thereof it doth grievously repent me,
and [I] therefore do now penance, as you
see me.” This charming rejoinder (again,
how More-like!) was in allusion to his
rough gown of Irish frieze, and a huge
black nightcap covering half of his newly
shaven face.</p>

<p>After all this mere hectoring, some pieces
of “evidence” were produced. One of
these was an intercepted letter which Campion
himself had written from the Tower
after his first and comparatively moderate
racking, while it was still possible to use
his hands; it was addressed to the admirable
and truly holy, but fussy, Mr. Thomas
Pounde, who, wild with alarm at the pretended
“betrayals,” had written to remonstrate
with Fr. Campion. The Queen’s
Counsel now read this passage from Campion’s
humble reply: “It grieveth me
much to have offended the Catholic cause
so highly as to confess the names of some
gentlemen and friends in whose houses I
had been entertained. Yet in this I greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
cherish and comfort myself: that I never
discovered any secrets there declared; and
that I will not, come rack, come rope!”
The comment of the reader in court was an
obvious one. “What can sound more suspiciously
or nearer unto treason than this
letter?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It must needs be some grievous
matter and very pernicious, that neither
rack nor rope can wring from him!” But
Campion’s even more obvious answer was
that there he spoke as one “by profession
and calling a priest,” vowed to silence in
regard to what was made known in the
Confessional, and yet pressed, on the rack,
to divulge secrets thus communicated to
him. “These were the hidden matters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in concealing of which I so greatly rejoiced,
to the revealing whereof I cannot nor will
not be brought, come rack, come rope!”
Well chosen was this answer of Campion’s.
It has been pointed out that
if he had stated here that he had told on
no one who was not already found out,
he would have loosed the informers and
man-hunters afresh on the whole Catholic
community, until his other friends, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had not been found out, were run down.
Instead of that he drew off attention by
reminding the court that he could not
repeat what had been sacramentally confided
to him. Most of his hearers were either
Catholic or had been Catholic, and acquiesced.
He spoke truth, but he skipped
explanations: and such is, more often than
not, the highest wisdom in this complex
world.</p>

<p>There were now read out certain papers
containing oaths to be administered to persons
ready to renounce their obedience to
her Majesty, and to be sworn of the Papal
allegiance alone. These were said to have
been found in houses where “Campion
had lurked, and for religion been entertained;”
hence they were of his composing.
He objected that the administering
of oaths was repugnant to him, and exceeded
his authority: “neither would I
commit an offence so thwart to my profession,
for all the substance and treasure in
the world.” He went on to say (assuming
for his purpose that the precious papers
were not forged, though they really were so),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that there was no proof of their connection
with himself, nor was it even pretended that
they were in his handwriting. Anderson
replied with singular perversity or dulness:
“You, a professed Papist, coming to a
house and then such reliques found after
your departure—how can it otherwise be
implied but that you did both bring them
and leave them there? So it is flat they
came there by means of a Papist: <i>ergo</i>, by
your means!” The logician in Campion
dashed to the fore. Could it be shown that
no other Papist ever visited that house but
himself? If not, they were urging a conclusion
before framing a minor! which is
imperfect, he added, and proves nothing.
Apparently Serjeant Anderson was sufficiently
enraged by now. His highly judicial
retort is on record. “If here, as you do in
Schools, you bring in your minor and conclusion,
you will prove yourself but a fool.
But minor or conclusion, I will bring it to
purpose anon!” Eliot then rose as witness,
and gave his account of the Sunday
sermon at Lyford: how Master Campion
spoke of enormities in England, and of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
day of change soon coming, welcome to the
shaken and dispersed Catholics, but dreadful
to the heretical masters of the land.
“What day should that be,” broke in the
Queen’s Counsel, “but that wherein the
Pope, the King of Spain, and the Duke of
Florence have appointed to invade this
realm?” Campion turned his eyes on Eliot.
“Oh, Judas, Judas!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As in all other
Christian commonwealths, so in England,
many vices and iniquities do abound .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
whereupon, as in every pulpit every Protestant
doth, I pronounced a great day, not
wherein any temporal potentate should
minister, but wherein the terrible Judge
should reveal all men’s consciences and try
every man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Any other day than this,
God He knows I meant not.” So much
for the astonishing “evidence” of this most
astonishing of all trials, one only, under
Pontius Pilate, excepted.</p>

<div class="caption">“Not Guilty!”</div><div class="attrib"><i><a href="#Page_151">p. 151.</a></i></div>
</div>

<p>The chief count against the defendant
was the old, old one of the Bull of Deposition,
and the denied authority of the Queen
in spirituals: that wretched family skeleton
trotted out once more! “You refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to swear to the Supremacy, a notorious
token of an evil willer to the Crown.”
Campion, who was surely what Antony
Wood quaintly calls him, “a sweete Disposition,
and a well-polish’d Man,”
stated his position once more, lucidly,
and with perfect temper. He began by
referring to what passed at the Earl of
Leicester’s London house. “Not long
since it pleased her Majesty to demand of
me whether I did acknowledge her to be my
Queen or no. I answered that I did acknowledge
her Highness not only as my
Queen, but also as my most lawful governess.
And being further required by her
Majesty whether I thought the Pope might
lawfully excommunicate her or no, I answered:
‘I confess myself an insufficient
umpire between her Majesty and the Pope
for so high a controversy, whereof neither
the certainty is yet known, nor the best
divines in Christendom stand fully resolved!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I acknowledge her Highness as my
governor and sovereign; I acknowledge
her Majesty both in fact and by right to be
Queen; I confess an obedience due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Crown as to my temporal head and primate.’
This I said then; so I say now. If then I
failed in aught, I am now ready to supply
it. What would you more? I will willingly
pay to her Majesty what is hers; yet I must
pay to God what is His. Then as for excommunicating
her Majesty, it was exacted
of me (admitting that excommunication
were of effect, and that the Pope had sufficient
authority so to do), whether then I
thought myself discharged of my allegiance
or no? I said that this was a dangerous
question, and that they that demanded this
demanded my blood. Admitting (why admitting?)
I would admit his authority, and
then he should excommunicate her, I would
then do as God should give me grace: but
I never admitted any such matter, neither
ought I to be wrested with any such suppositions.”
To all this no rejoinder was
made. It was the identical position taken
up by many another harassed martyr. The
prosecution next turned to the remaining
prisoners, using the same weak, wrong,
skirmishing tactics,—Campion often putting
in a word to hearten one, to defend another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to guide a third. At a certain point he exclaimed:
“So great are the treasons that I
and the others have wrought, that the
gaoler who has us in charge told me at
night that would we but go to the Anglican
services they would pardon us straightway!”
Serrano, who reports this, adds:
“They answered things in general.” At
the close of the proceedings, their issue
being prearranged, Campion was allowed
to make a speech to the jurors. He eloquently
begged them to seek for certainties,
and to remember the character of the “evidence”
brought before them. Alas! he
was appealing to bought men, who dared
not be true.</p>

<p>The pleadings had taken three hours; the
jury deliberated, or seemed to do so, for an
hour or more. Public opinion in the Hall,
as at the Tower conferences, was overwhelmingly
in favour of Campion. But “the poor
twelve,” as Allen calls them, came back,
fearful to be found “no friend of Cæsar,”
bringing in a verdict against the whole company
as “guilty of the said treasons and
conspiracies.” The Lord Chief Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
spoke: “Campion, and the rest, what can
you say why you should not die?” Then
Campion broke out into a brief appeal
to the future and the past, a lyric strain
such as was not often heard beneath
those ancient rafters, so sadly used to the
spectacle of noble hearts in jeopardy. “It
was not our death that ever we feared!
But we knew that we were not lords of our
own lives, and therefore for want of answer
would not be guilty of our own deaths.
The only thing that we have now to say is,
that if our religion do make us traitors we
are worthy to be condemned; but otherwise
we are and have been as true subjects as
ever the Queen had. In condemning us
you condemn all your own ancestors, all the
ancient priests, Bishops and Kings: all
that was once the glory of England, the
Island of Saints, and the most devoted child
of the See of Peter. For what have we
taught (however you may qualify it with
the odious name of treason), that they did
not uniformly teach? To be condemned
with these old lights, not of England
only, but of the world, by their degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
descendants, is both gladness and glory to
us! God lives. Posterity will live. Their
judgment is not so liable to corruption as
that of those who are now going to sentence
us to death.” After which the Lord Chief
Justice pronounced the formula in use for
all prisoners condemned to capital punishment.
“Ye must go to the place whence
ye came, there to remain until ye shall be
drawn through the open city of London
upon hurdles to the place of execution, and
there be hanged and let down alive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and your entrails taken out and burnt in
your sight; then your heads to be cut off,
and your bodies to be divided in four parts,
to be disposed of at her Majesty’s pleasure.
And may God have mercy on your souls!”
Some of the company raised a storm of
protest, but Campion’s voice rose above
theirs, crying: “We praise Thee, O
God!” Sherwin seconded him with the
shouted anthem of Eastertide: “This is
the day that the Lord hath made: let us
rejoice and be glad therein!” Like expressions
of triumph were presently taken up,
to the amazement of bystanders. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
doomed men were parted, and were all
taken away, Edmund Campion being put in
a barge on the Thames, and rowed back to
the Tower, where he was heavily shackled
with irons, and left alone.</p>

<h2>XIII<br />

<small>VICTORY: DECEMBER 1, 1581</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">EVEN thus late, fresh proffers were
made to buy Campion over to the
State religion. Such a circumstance,
as he had claimed previously, is in itself a
plain disproof of any treason. Hopton, who
hated him, sent Campion’s own sister to him
with the repeated offer of a very rich benefice.
To the cell door came one day none
other than George Eliot, saying that he
would never have trapped Fr. Edmund, had
he thought that anything worse than imprisonment
could be in store. He also told
the man of God whom he had wronged past
reparation that he stood in danger from the
wrath of the Catholics, and feared their reprisals
for his late actions. Campion persuaded
him that they would never push
revenge so far as to seek his life, but added
that if Eliot were truly repentant he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
have a letter of recommendation to a Catholic
Duke in Germany, who would employ
and protect him. Delahays, the keeper, in
the discharge of his office, had to stand
close to the prisoner during this interview,
and what he heard sank into his mind and
made him a convert. Outside the Tower,
there was a ferment of excitement over this
one of its inmates, and over the question
whether the indignation of all Europe
should be braved by carrying out his sentence.
The Earl of Desmond, the accessory,
and Dr. Sanders, the co-principal, of
the late revolt in western Ireland, were still
hiding in woods and caves, and weathering
the hardships which were to be dismally
ended for both during the coming spring.
Burghley concisely said, in the finest Elizabethan
spirit of punishing somebody—no
great matter whom—when any row was
made, that “Campion and Sanders were in
the same boat, and as they could not catch
Sanders, they must hang Campion instead.”
The princely visitor was still at Court, and
high festival went on from day to day. The
preoccupation of the Queen with him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
his affairs was thought to be an excellent
item of the programme, as it kept her from
thinking of Campion and his fate. Delay
was dreaded as a means of getting together
of the great English nobles, and the foreign
ambassadors, with petitions for Campion’s
release; and it was thought that the Queen
would never resist any strongly-worded
request which so corroborated her own
supposed secret feeling. The Council still
thought his destruction desirable. Meanwhile,
instant appeal was made to the Duke,
by the Catholics generally, to use his influence
in Campion’s behalf: he promised to
intercede for him, and may have done so.
At the last moment further pressure was
brought to bear. His confessor was sent
into the tennis court, where the Duke was
about to begin a game, with this message:
that the royal blood of France would be disgraced
for ever, if so foul a judicial murder
were not checked. The little great personage,
thus accosted, as we are told by
Bombino, stroked his face absent-mindedly
with his left hand; then raised his right
hand, with the racket in it, and called to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
opposite to him: “Play!” Not another
word did he answer to the tragic matter so
thrust upon him.</p>

<p>Burghley fixed upon November 25, a
Saturday, as the date for Campion’s execution.
Sherwin was appointed to die in his
company, as representing the Seminary at
Rheims. They were taken together one day
into the Lieutenant’s Hall to face some endless
argument or other. The opponent,
“by report of such as stood by, was never
so holden up to the wall in his life.” On the
way back to their cells, under guard, they
crossed one of the Tower courts. “Ah,
Father Campion!” said his young comrade,
smiling at the welcome London sun, “I shall
shortly be above yon fellow.” Even one
hurried free breath of fresh air must have
meant much to Campion. To be “clapped
up a close prisoner,” as he had been from the
first, meant that his windows were blocked,
and their minimum of air strained through a
narrow slanted funnel, latticed at its skyward
end, and with but one tiny pane occasionally
opened at the bottom. But these things,
humanly intolerable, counted for little on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the threshold of light and liberty everlasting.
“Delay of our death doth somewhat
dull me,” wrote Sherwin, touchingly, to a
friend. “Truth it is, I had hoped ere this,
casting off this body of death, to have kissed
the precious, glorified wounds of my sweet
Saviour, sitting in the Throne of His
Father’s own glory.” There was a good
deal of haggling and hesitation on the subject.
By statute law any caught priest was
hangable; but public opinion (as Simpson
reminds us in a brilliant page) did not
always run with the statute law. Moreover,
Camden says expressly that the Queen (who
is supposed to have supervised and approved
all he wrote) did not believe in the “treasons”
charged to the “silly priests.” It is
remarkable that the first defensive pamphlet
put forth by the Government after Campion’s
death, was one “in which the plot
of Rheims and Rome was prudently forgotten—the
very matter of the indictment!”</p>

<p>By the time the day for the execution
was finally set for Friday, the first of December,
a third priest had been chosen from
the waiting batch of victims, as representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the English College at Rome. This
was the Blessed Alexander Briant, who had
applied from his prison cell for admission
into the Society of Jesus, a fact not known to
his persecutors. If the entry of his age in the
Oxford Matriculation Lists be correct (as is
most likely), he was now only in his twenty-sixth
year. He was grave and gentle in
character, full of charm, and of the most
extraordinary personal beauty. He had
been carried off in the course of a descent on
Fr. Parsons’ London rooms, starved and
parched in the Marshalsea, tortured by
needles, and kept in the entire darkness of
deep dungeons in the Tower. Norton, the
Rackmaster, on three occasions, proceeded
(in his own phrase) to “make him a foot
longer than God made him,” yet he adds that
“he stood still with express refusal that he
would tell the truth.” The “truth” meant
information of the whereabouts of Fr. Parsons,
a former tutor and devoted friend, and
of the place where Parsons’ books were
being printed. Briant had been condemned
the day after Campion’s trial, in Westminster
Hall, where his angelic looks, out-lasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a hell of almost unique torment, did
not pass unnoticed by the public. Here
(though some accounts say it was at the
scaffold) he carried in the palm of his hand,
and gazed upon often, a little cross of rough
wood which he had managed to whittle in
his cell, and on which he had traced an outline
in charcoal of the figure of the Crucified.
Pedro Serrano, the secretary of the Spanish
Ambassador, saw it taken away from Briant,
and heard him say: “You can wrest it from
my hand, but never from my heart.” Not
long afterwards George Gilbert died in
Italy, kissing Blessed Alexander’s little
cross, which he must have taken pains to
buy back.</p>

<p>These three, Fathers Campion, Sherwin,
and Briant, were led forth on a bitter morning,
and bound to their hurdles, in the rain,
outside the Tower gates. Campion’s life for
the past week had been nothing but fasting,
watching and prayer, and he was never in
more gallant spirits. “God save you all,
gentlemen!” so he saluted the crowd, on
first coming out: “God bless you all, and
make you all good Catholics!” The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
younger men were strapped down on one
hurdle side by side, Campion alone on the
other. The mud was thick in the unpaved
streets of London, and the double span of
horses, each flat hurdle being tied to two
tails, went at a great pace through Cheapside,
Newgate Street, and Holborn. There
were intervals, however, when the jolted and
bemired prisoners were able to speak with
their sympathizers, who surged in upon
them, and thus saved them for the moment
from the incessant annoyance of Charke and
other accompanying fanatics. Some asked
Fr. Campion’s blessing; some spoke in his
ear matters of conscience; one gentleman
courteously bent down and wiped the
priest’s bespattered face: “for which
charity, or haply some sudden-moved affection,
may God reward him!” says one
annalist who saw the kind deed done.</p>

<p>The New Gate spanned the street where
the prison named after it stood until yesterday;
and in a niche of the New Gate was
still a statue of Our Lady: this Fr. Campion
reverenced, raising his head and his
bound body, as best he could, as he passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
under. The three martyrs were seen to be
smiling, nay, laughing, and the people commented
with wonder on their light-heartedness.
A mile or so of sheer country at the
end of the road, and Tyburn was at hand,
stark against a cloudy sky, with a vast
crowd waiting to see the sacrifice: “more
than three thousand horse,” says Serrano,
in the contemporary letter already quoted,
“and an infinite number of souls.” And he
goes on, in the truest Catholic temper,
speaking for himself, the Ambassador, and
their little circle, to say, “there was no one
of us who had not envy of their death.” Just
as the hurdles halted, the sudden sun shone
out and lit up the gallows with its hanging
halters. Fr. Campion was set upon his
feet, put into the hangman’s cart, driven
under the triangular beams, and told to
put his head into the noose. This the first
martyr of the English Jesuits did with all
meekness. Then, “with grave countenance
and sweet voice,” he began to speak, as he
supposed he was to be allowed to do,
according to custom. He took the text of
St. Paul: “We are made a spectacle unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the world, and to angels, and to men: we
are fools for Christ’s sake.” Sir Francis
Knowles and other officials promptly
interrupted him, and reminded him to
confess his treason. So once more he
must needs say: “I desire you all to
bear witness with me that I am thereof
altogether innocent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am a Catholic
man and a priest: in that faith have I lived,
and in that faith do I intend to die. If you
esteem my religion treason, then am I
guilty. As for other treason, I never committed
any: God is my judge.” He spoke
of the names which he had been hoodwinked
into confessing, and protested that all the
“secrets” held back were spiritual confidences,
and that there were no “secrets”
of another nature between his hosts and
him; he also put in a plea for one Richardson,
imprisoned on account of the <i>Decem
Rationes</i>, whereas he knew nothing whatever
of that book. He then tried to pray.
But a school-master with lungs, named
Hearne, hastily stepped forward and read a
novel proclamation, first and last of its
kind, declaring in the Queen’s name that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
these men about to be executed were perishing
not for religion but for treason. Diligent
reassertion, in those days, seems to
have established anything as a fact!</p>

<p>The lords and sheriffs present reverted to
“the bloody question”: what did Master
Campion think of the Bull of Pius Quintus
and the excommunication of the Queen?
and would he renounce the Pope of Rome?
He answered wearily that he was a Catholic.
One voice shouted: “In your Catholicism
all treason is contained!” A minister came
forward to bid the martyr pray with him,
but with marked gentleness was denied his
will. “You and I are not one in religion:
wherefore, I pray you, content yourself. I
bar none of prayer, but I only desire them
of the Household of Faith to pray with me,
and in mine agony to say one Creed.” The
Creed was chosen “to signify that he died
for the confession of the Catholic and Apostolic
Faith.” He endeavoured again to
pray, probably using aloud the words of
some of the Vulgate Psalms or ritual
hymns, when a spectator called out angrily
to him to pursue his devotions in English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
“I will pray unto God,” answered Campion,
with all himself in the answer, “in a
language which we both well understand!”
He was again interrupted, and ordered to
ask forgiveness of the Queen, and to pray
for her. But his sweetness and patience
held out till the last. “Wherein have I
offended her? In this am I innocent: this
is my last speech: in this give me credit. I
have and do pray for her.” “Pray you
for Queen—Elizabeth?” was the insinuating
query, made often, and answered often,
as here. Campion said: “Yea, for Elizabeth,
your Queen and my Queen, unto
whom I wish a long, quiet reign, with all
prosperity.” He had barely finished this
emphatic sentence when the cart was drawn
away. The multitude with one accord
swayed and groaned. Somebody in authority
(one account names the Chamberlain
of the Royal Household, Lord Howard
of Effingham) mercifully forbade the hangman
to cut the rope until he was quite dead.
That other rope with which Campion was
bound Parsons managed to buy, and he had
it laid about his own neck when he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
die, in 1610. It is now at Stonyhurst: a
thin, frayed old cord some twelve feet long.</p>

<p>Close to the quartering-block stood a
spectator, a young gallant of twenty-three,
eldest son of a Norfolk house, who had
great gifts of mind, and was given to writing
verses: his name was Henry Walpole.
He was a Catholic, though, it would seem,
a worldly one. His generous instincts of
humanity, however, had led him to befriend
hunted priests; and a love of Campion, in
particular, was already kindled in him
through this association. As the executioner
threw the severed limbs of a blessed
soul into the great smoking cauldron, to
parboil them before they were stuck on
spikes, according to sentence, a few drops
were splashed out upon Henry Walpole’s
doublet. The incident roused his mind and
pierced his heart, and was to him the instant
cry of his vocation. Like many another
spiritual son of Blessed Edmund Campion
(and nearer to him than they, because he
entered the Society), he was granted the
glory of following him, through faults of
his own, through innumerable hardships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and through martyrdom at York, in April,
1595, into the peace of Paradise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hangman had seized the
second victim, saying: “Come, Sherwin!
take thou also thy wages.” That manly
man looked upon the bare bloody arm of
the other, and eager to show some public
veneration of his sainted leader, first bent
forward and kissed it; then he leaped into
the cart. Young Briant presently endured
death for the Faith with an even calmer
courage. The populace, much wrought up
over all three, went home, through the
winter mists, in tears. Most of them who
had prejudices against the Church lost them
for good; and very many straightway
entered her communion.</p>

<p>The Government sent forth publication
after publication in lame defence of its
action. Soon France, Austria, Italy, were
inundated with accounts of the event; these
everywhere produced the deepest impression.
At home, a great tidal wave of conversion
to the old Church swept in.</p>

<p>Campion’s death, last and best of his
wonderful missionary labours, bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
most astonishing fruit. The long storm of
persecution raged at its full fierceness after
1581, and it burst over the heads not only
of a far more numerous, but a far more
heroic body. Edmund Campion’s spirit had
been built in good time, as it were, into the
unsteady wall.</p>

<p>Robert Parsons had an intense feeling
for his first comrade-in-arms. “I understand
of the advancement and exaltation of
my dear brother Mr. Campion, and his
fellows. Our Lord be blessed for it! it is
the joyfullest news in one respect that ever
came to my heart.” This same feeling
breaks out with powerful irony, addressing
the “Geneva-coloured” clerics, who so
long harassed the martyr-group of 1581.
“Their blood will, I doubt not, fight
against your errors and impiety many hundred
years after you are passed from the
world altogether.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are well bestowed
upon you: you have used them to
the best.”</p>

<p>And Allen, in a private letter, says on his
part: “Ten thousand sermons would not
have published our apostolic faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
religion so winningly as the fragrance of
these victims, most sweet both to God and
to men.”</p>

<p>No remote mystic was Edmund Campion,
but a man of his age, with much endearing
human circumstance about him and in him.
Caring for nothing but the things of the
soul, he had yet caught the ear and the
eye of the nation. The tidings of his
end meant much to many of the great
Elizabethans: not least personal was it,
perhaps, to the lad Shakespeare, whose
father had been settled as a stout Recusant
by the Warwickshire ministrations of
Parsons.</p>

<p>An aged priest, Gregory Gunne, came
up before the Council in 1585, his thoughts
and tongue too busy in Campion’s praise.
The day would come, he said, when a religious
house would stand as a votive offering on
the spot where “the only man in England”
had perished. There was still no sign of
such a thing when Mr. Richard Simpson’s
great monograph was first published,
and that was twenty years before Pope
Leo XIII beatified the Blessed Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Campion on December 9, 1886. But now
there is a Convent with Perpetual Adoration
in its little chapel, and two bright
English flags ever leaning against the altar,
on that ground of the London Tyburn: and
is it wonderful that the vision of a worthier
memorial haunts the imagination of those
who go there to pray for their country?</p>

<p>Blessed Edmund Campion was “a religious
genius,” with a creative spirituality
given to few, even among the canonized
children of the Fold. But in his kinship
with his place and time, his peculiar gentleness,
his scholarship lightly worn, his
magic influence, his fearless deed and flawless
word, he was a great Elizabethan too.
He had sacrificed his fame and changed his
career. He had spent himself for a cause
the world can never love, and by so doing
he has courted the ill-will of what passed for
history, up to our own day. But no serious
student now mistakes the reason why his
own England found no use for her “diamond”
other than the one strange use to
which she put him. He is sure at last of
justice. In the Church, that name of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
will have a never-dying beauty, though it
is not quite where it might have been on the
secular roll-call. To understand this is also
to rejoice in it: for why should we look to
find there at all, those who are “hidden
with Christ in God”?</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
